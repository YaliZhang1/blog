{"title": "Ideas and Kvetch!", "content": "<p>It\u2019s a new year, and we have a new major release of WordPress coming soon. (We\u2019re currently aiming for the 22nd.) It\u2019s as good a time as any to examine where we\u2019ve been, and where we are, and where we\u2019re going as a community. 2006 was a pretty exciting year, we saw 1.54 million downloads of WP, and that\u2019s not even counting the people who install it through their host\u2019s one-click install or the half a million who have experienced it through the hosted WordPress.com. WordPress is touching more lives than ever.</p>\n<p>However, just because what we\u2019ve done has worked in the past doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the best for the future. We have to take a self-critical look at assumptions we have about our development process and WP itself. The upcoming release, which has been long coming, is a perfect time to focus on WP\u2019s secret ingredient\u2026 you.</p>\n<p>If you could add anything in the world to WordPress, what would it be? If you could name the thing that frustrates you the most about WP, what would that be?</p>\n<p>Now you can tell us. We\u2019re announcing new projects\u2014two sides of the same coin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/\">The first is simply called Ideas</a>, and it\u2019s a place where you can share your wildest WordPress wishes with the world, and also vote on other people\u2019s ideas. This allows people outside our normal circle of developers to have a direct say in what goes into the next version of WordPress. For 2.2, which comes out in late April, we will include the top voted on features, so propose something, tell your friends about it, and link it from your blog.</p>\n<p>The second we\u2019ve named after the <a href=\"http://www.answers.com/kvetch\">Yiddish word</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/kvetch/\">Kvetch</a>. This is a place where you can quickly and anonymously express whatever might disagree with you in the WordPress world. Let it all loose, but try to keep it PG rated, and we\u2019ll show a random kvetch on the page once we get enough in the system.</p>\n<p>Both are just part of putting you guys\u2014our users\u2014first. It\u2019s easy because there\u2019s so many of you.</p>"},
{"title": "Plugin Directory", "content": "<p>One of the greatest things about WordPress has always been the amazing number of high-quality plugins available for the platform. I believe that there aren\u2019t any more \u201ckiller features\u201d in software, there are 10,000 killer features and everyone has a different 20. If we tried to put everything into WordPress the result would be, for lack of a better term, bloated. However through our robust plugin API people have used WordPress as a platform for building almost anything you can imagine leveraging the huge WP userbase and scalable core codebase.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s all fine and dandy, but having all these plugins isn\u2019t that useful if you\u2019ve got no place to find them. Even though we have provided development hosting at <a href=\"http://wp-plugins.org\">wp-plugins.org</a> for years, we hadn\u2019t had a user interface to the plugins hosted there, which I think was a travesty.</p>\n<p>No longer! Our ever-expanding \u201cextend\u201d section <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/\">now has a brand-spanking new plugins directory</a> where you can browse, download, rate, and comment on all your favorite plugins. I highly encourage you to go check it out.</p>\n<p>For users, this means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is now a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/\">central place to find and download WordPress plugins</a>.</li>\n<li>You can get a much better idea about plugin quality and compatibility from the site.</li>\n<li>In the future you\u2019ll be able to get notification inside of WordPress about plugins you use that have updates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers, you now have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exposure to the millions of people who visit WordPress.org every month.</li>\n<li>Free SVN hosting for GPL plugin development at wp-plugins.org. (Like always.)</li>\n<li>Automatic download packages and free hosting of those.</li>\n<li>Statistics about how many people are using and downloading your plugins.</li>\n<li>Prominent links to your homepage, and the ability to specify a Paypal donation link from your plugin page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a developer all you need to do to start taking advantage of the new plugin pages is to include a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/\">properly formatted readme.txt file</a> along with your plugin.</p>\n<p>Props to <a href=\"http://blogwaffe.com/\">Michael Adams</a>, <a href=\"http://txfx.net/\">Mark Jaquith</a>, and <a href=\"http://iammattthomas.com/\">Matt Thomas</a> for making this dream a reality.

Since then most theme authors have been distributing their themes from their own sites, without a good centralized place for people to browse, search, comment on, and rate themes.  With the success of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/\">plugins directory</a>, we\u2019ve wanted to have those same benefits in a theme directory.

From there you upload your regular theme zip file and we take care of the rest.</p>\n<p>Once you upload your new theme we do a few automated checks for some of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/themes/about/#requirements\">requirements</a> for each theme.  If we find one that you missed we\u2019ll provide you an error and description of what needs to be fixed.  When a theme upload has been accepted we\u2019ll send you an email and put it in the queue to be reviewed, to make sure we didn\u2019t miss anything.  After the theme has been approved you\u2019ll get another email letting you know that the theme is now live.</p>\n<p>That catches you up to where we\u2019re at today.  When you finish that theme you\u2019ve been slaving over, upload it to the new directory and let us know what you think.

{"title": "Themes are GPL, too", "content": "<p>If WordPress were a country, our Bill of Rights would be <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/\">the GPL</a> because it <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html\">protects our core freedoms</a>. We\u2019ve always done our best to keep WordPress.org clean and only promote things that are completely compatible and legal with WordPress\u2019s license. There have been some questions in the community about whether the GPL applies to themes like we\u2019ve always assumed. To help clarify this point, I reached out to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Freedom_Law_Center\">Software Freedom Law Center</a>, the world\u2019s pre\u00ebminent experts on the GPL, which spent time with WordPress\u2019s code, community, and provided us with an official legal opinion. One sentence summary: PHP in WordPress themes must be GPL, artwork and CSS may be but are not required.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Matt,</p>\n<p>You asked the Software Freedom Law Center to clarify the status of themes as derivative works of WordPress, a content management software package written in PHP and licensed under version 2 of the GNU General Public License.</p>\n<p>We examined release candidate 1 of WordPress 2.8, which you provided to us at https://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.8-RC1.tar.gz.  The \u201cclassic\u201d and \u201cdefault\u201d themes included in that release candidate comprise various PHP and CSS files along with an optional directory of images.  The PHP files contain a mix of HTML markup and PHP calls to<br>\nWordPress functions.  There is some programmatic logic in the PHP code, including loops and conditionals.</p>\n<p>When WordPress is started, it executes various routines that prepare information for use by themes.  In normal use, control is then transferred via PHP\u2019s include() function to HTML and PHP templates found in theme package files.  The PHP code in those template files relies on the earlier-prepared information to fill the templates for serving to the client.</p>\n<p>On the basis of that version of WordPress, and considering those themes as if they had been added to WordPress by a third party, it is our opinion that the themes presented, and any that are substantially similar, contain elements that are derivative works of the WordPress software as well as elements that are potentially separate works. Specifically, the CSS files and material contained in the images directory of the \u201cdefault\u201d theme are works separate from the WordPress code.  On the other hand, the PHP and HTML code that is intermingled with and operated on by PHP the code derives from the WordPress code.</p>\n<p>In the WordPress themes, CSS files and images exist purely as data to be served by a web server.  WordPress itself ignores these files[1]. The CSS and image files are simply read by the server as data and delivered verbatim to the user, avoiding the WordPress instance altogether.  The CSS and images could easily be used with a range of HTML documents and read and displayed by a variety of software having no relation to WordPress.  As such, these files are separate works from the WordPress code itself.</p>\n<p>The PHP elements, taken together, are clearly derivative of WordPress code.  The template is loaded via the include() function.  Its contents are combined with the WordPress code in memory to be processed by PHP along with (and completely indistinguishable from) the rest of WordPress.  The PHP code consists largely of calls to WordPress functions and sparse, minimal logic to control which WordPress functions are accessed and how many times they will be called.  They are derivative of WordPress because every part of them is determined by the content of the WordPress functions they call.  As works of authorship, they are designed only to be combined with WordPress into a larger work.</p>\n<p>HTML elements are intermingled with PHP in the two themes presented. These snippets of HTML interspersed with PHP throughout the theme PHP files together form a work whose form is highly dependent on the PHP and thus derivative of it.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the WordPress themes supplied contain elements that are derivative of WordPress\u2019s copyrighted code.  These themes, being collections of distinct works (images, CSS files, PHP files), need not be GPL-licensed as a whole.  Rather, the PHP files are subject to the requirements of the GPL while the images and CSS are not.  Third-party developers of such themes may apply restrictive copyrights to these elements if they wish.</p>\n<p>Finally, we note that it might be possible to design a valid WordPress theme that avoids the factors that subject it to WordPress\u2019s copyright, but such a theme would have to forgo almost all the WordPress functionality that makes the software useful.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br>\nJames Vasile<br>\nSoftware Freedom Law Center</p>\n<p>[1] There is one exception.  WordPress does reads CSS and image files to create previews of templates for the template selection portion of the administrative interface.  Even in that case, though, nothing in those files calls any WordPress functions, is treated as a command by PHP, or alters any other WordPress data structure.  These files are read as data and used to create an image and display a miniaturized version of a webpage to the user.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Even though graphics and CSS aren\u2019t <em>required</em> to be GPL legally, the lack thereof is pretty limiting. Can you imagine WordPress without any CSS or javascript? So as before, we will only promote and host things on WordPress.org that are 100% GPL <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility\">or compatible</a>. To celebrate a few folks creating 100% GPL themes and providing support and other services around them, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/themes/commercial/\">we have a new page listing GPL commercially supported themes</a>.</p>"},

{"title": "Plugin Directory Refreshed", "content": "<p>Been hanging out with a few WordPress.org hackers \u2014 Scott, Nacin, and Otto \u2014 the last few days in a BBQ-fueled haze of hacking to make plugin directory better.

We\u2019ve made authors much more prominent and with bigger Gravatars and better placement, so you can get a sense of who made the plugin you\u2019re using. And finally to show how active and well-supported a plugin is, you can see \u00a0\u201c16 of 75 support threads in the last two weeks have been resolved.\u201d Finally, if you\u2019re logged in you get access to the new \u201cfavorites\u201d feature that lets you mark the plugins you use the most so you can share them on your profile page and find them quickly later. We soft-launched favorites a few days ago and there have already been 2,000 saved!</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a plugin author, we\u2019ve started with a short threshold (2 weeks) for the resolved stats so it\u2019s easy to catch up and stay on top of it. (It\u2019ll eventually go to two months.) You also now have the ability to set stickies on your plugin forum to put FAQs or important information at the top, and of course any person you put as a committer on the plugin will have moderation access. People on the forum tag will see your custom header and links to the other resources attached to your plugin.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve tightened up the styling a bit on the forums and plugin pages, though still some cleanups to do there. Some older improvements you might have missed, but are still useful for users and developers alike:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cPlugin headers\u201d or those cool graphics you see at the top of plugin pages have really taken off, there are over 1,600 active now.</li>\n<li>You can now subscribe to get an email whenever a commit is made to a plugin repository even if it isn\u2019t yours. There is no better way to follow the development of your favorite plugins. There\u2019s nothing like the smell of fresh changesets in the morning.</li>\n<li>Behind the scenes, we\u2019ve dramatically ramped up proactive scanning of the entire repository to help authors fix security and other problems they might not even know about yet. The quality level of the repo has gone way, way up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this will continue to evolve as we get feedback and see usage, but we\u2019re happy to have been able to make some key improvements in just a few days while hanging out in Memphis.

From a discussion between myself and <a href=\"http://mikelittle.org/\">Mike Little</a> about <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\">forking our favorite blogging software</a>, to powering 18% of the web. It\u2019s been a crazy, exciting, journey, and one that won\u2019t stop any time soon.</p>\n<p>At ten years, it\u2019s fun to reflect on our beginnings. We launched WordPress on 27th May 2003, but that wasn\u2019t inception. Go back far enough, and you can <a href=\"http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/\">read a post by Michel Valdrighi</a> who, frustrated by the self-hosted blogging platforms available, decided to write his own software; \u201cb2, a PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and GreyMatter.\u201d b2 was easy to install, easy to configure, and easy for developers to extend. Of all the blogging platforms out there, <a href=\"http://cafelog.com\">b2</a> was the right one for me: I could write my content and get it on the web quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, life gets in the way. In 2002, Michel stopped maintaining b2. Over time, security flaws became apparent and updates were needed and, while the b2 community could write patches and fixes, no one was driving the software forward. We were lucky that Michel decided to release b2 under the GPL; the software may have been abandoned, but we weren\u2019t without options. A fork was always a possibility. That was where it stood in January 2003, when <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\">I posted about forking b2</a> and <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/#comment-445\">Mike responded</a>. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>From the very beginning to the present day, I\u2019ve been impressed by the thought, care, and dedication that WordPress\u2019 developers have demonstrated. Each one has brought his or her unique perspective, each individual has strengthened the whole. It would be impossible to thank each of them here individually, but their achievements speak for themselves. In WordPress 1.2 the new Plugin API made it easy for developers to extend WordPress. In the same release <code>gettext()</code> internationalization opened WordPress up to every language (hat tip: <a href=\"http://ryan.boren.me/\">Ryan Boren</a> for spending hours wrapping strings with gettext). In WordPress 1.5 our Theme system made it possible for WordPress users to quickly change their site\u2019s design: there was huge resistance to the theme system from the wider community at the time, but can you imagine WordPress without it? Versions 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 saw improvements that let users install and update their plugins and themes with one click. WordPress has seen a redesign by <a href=\"http://v2.happycog.com/create/wordpress/?p=design/wordpress/\">happycog</a> (2.3) and gone under extensive user testing and redesign (<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/edanzico/riding-the-crazyhorse-future-generation-wordpress-presentation\">Crazyhorse</a>, Liz Danzico and Jen Mylo, WordPress 2.5). In WordPress 3.0 we merged WordPress MU with WordPress \u2014 a huge job but 100% worth it. And in WordPress 3.5 we revamped the media uploader to make it easier for people to get their images, video, and media online.</p>\n<p>In sticking to our commitment to user experience, we\u2019ve done a few things that have made us unpopular. The <a href=\"http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-wysiwyg-editor-is-a-disaster/\">WYSIWYG editor</a> was hated by many, especially those who felt that if you have a blog you should know HTML. Some developers hated that we stuck with our code, refusing to rewrite, but it\u2019s always been the users that matter: better a developer lose sleep than a site break for a user. Our code isn\u2019t always beautiful, after all, when WordPress was created most of us were still learning PHP, but we try to make a flawless experience for users.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not all about developers. WordPress\u2019 strength lies in the diversity of its community. From the start, we wanted a low barrier to entry and we came up with our \u201cfamous 5 minute install\u201d. This brought on board users from varied technical background: people who didn\u2019t write code wanted to help make WordPress better. If you couldn\u2019t write code, it didn\u2019t matter: you could answer a question in the support forums, write documentation, translate WordPress, or build your friends and family a WordPress website. There is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">space in the community</a> for anyone with a passion for WordPress.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s been wonderful to see all of the people who have used WordPress to build their home on the internet. Early on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/switchers/\">we got excited</a> by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/more-switchers/\">switchers</a>. From a community of tinkerers we grew, as writers such as <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2004/05/om-malik/\">Om Malik</a>, <a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2004/05/15/mark-pilgrim-switches/\">Mark Pilgrim</a>, and <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2004/07/mollycom-switches/\">Molly Holzschlag</a> made the switch to WordPress. Our commitment to effortless publishing quickly paid off and has continued to do so: <strong>the WordPress 1.2 release saw 822 downloads per day, our latest release, WordPress 3.5, has seen 145,692 per day.</strong></p>\n<p>I\u2019m continually amazed by what people have built with WordPress. I\u2019ve seen <a href=\"http://justintimberlake.com/main/\">musicians</a> and <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2013/01/neil-leifer-on-wordpress/\">photographers</a>, magazines such as <a href=\"http://life.time.com/\">Life</a>, <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/\">BoingBoing</a>, and the <a href=\"http://observer.com/\">New York Observer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.compliance.gov/\">government websites</a>, a <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/pressfs-a-wordpress-filesystem/\">filesystem</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ymcanyc.org/association/pages/y-mvp\"> mobile applications</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.viper007bond.com/2010/06/12/so-apparently-wordpress-can-guide-missiles/\">seen WordPress guide missiles</a>.</p>\n<p>As the web evolves, WordPress evolves. Factors outside of our control will always influence WordPress\u2019 development: today it\u2019s mobile devices and retina display, tomorrow it could be Google Glass or technology not yet conceived. A lot can happen in ten years! As technology changes and advances, WordPress has to change with it while remaining true to its core values: making publishing online easy for everyone. How we rise to these challenges will be what defines WordPress over the coming ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>To celebrate ten years of WordPress, we\u2019re working on a book about our history.</strong> We\u2019re carrying out interviews with people who have involved with the community from the very beginning, those who are still around, and those who have left. It\u2019s a huge project, but we wanted to have something to share with you on the 10th anniversary. To learn about the very early days of WordPress, just after Mike and I forked b2 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/history/\">you can download Chapter 3 right here</a>. We\u2019ll be releasing the rest of the book serially, so watch out as the story of the last ten years emerges.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/\"> I penned my own letter to WordPress</a> and other community members have been sharing their thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://zed1.com/journalized/archives/2013/01/25/wordpress-a-10-year-journey/\">Mike Little on our Ten Year Journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Core contributor Helen Hou-Sandi <a href=\"http://helen.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/happy-10th-wordpress-and-thanks-from-my-little-family/\">wishes WordPress happy birthday</a>.</li>\n<li>Peter Westwood on <a href=\"http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2013/05/27/a-decade-gone-more-to-come/\">a decade gone</a>.</li>\n<li>Support rep Mika Epstein <a href=\"http://ipstenu.org/2013/you-me-and-wp/\">on her WordPress journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Dougal Campbell <a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2013/05/27/instagram-my-wife-suzecampbell-and-i-celebrating-the-wordpress-10th-anniversary-with-bbq-in-our-wordpress-shirts-wp10/\">celebrating with his wife, Suze</a>.</li>\n<li>Otto on <a href=\"http://ottodestruct.com/blog/2013/how-wp-affected-me/\">how WordPress affected him</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see how WordPress\u2019 10th Anniversary was celebrated all over the world <a href=\"http://wp10.wordpress.net/\">by visiting the wp10 website</a>, according to Meetup we had 4,999 celebrators.</p>\n<p>To finish, I just want to say thank you to everyone: to the developers who write the code, to the designers who make WordPress sing, to the worldwide community translating WordPress into so many languages, to volunteers who answer support questions, to those who make WordPress accessible, to the systems team and the plugin and theme reviewers, to documentation writers, event organisers, evangelists, detractors, supporters and friends. Thanks to the jazzers whose music inspired us and whose names are at the heart of WordPress. Thanks to everyone who uses WordPress to power their blog or website, and to everyone who will in the future. Thanks to WordPress and its community that I\u2019m proud to be part of.</p>\n<p>Thank you. I can\u2019t wait to see what the next ten years bring.</p>\n<p><em>Final thanks to <a href=\"http://siobhanmckeown.com/\">Siobhan McKeown</a> for help with this post.</em></p>"},
{"title": "Lucky Seven", "content": "<p>Has it really been seven years since the first release of WordPress? It seems like just yesterday we were fresh to the world, a new entrant to a market  everyone said was already saturated. (As a side note, if the common perception is that a market is finished and that everything interesting has been done already, it\u2019s probably a really good time to enter it.)</p>\n<p>The growth over the past year has blown me away. Since our last birthday we\u2019ve doubled theme downloads to over 10 million, and doubled plugin downloads to 60 million. Most importantly, we continued to grow the development community to 1,528 people active on Trac and 13 committers, both numbers the highest in the history of WordPress.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s 1,528 people pouring their hearts and souls into GPL software we all own, we all build on, we can use as we please, we can all make better. We\u2019ve evolved from a simple script to a web platform.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re on the cusp of version 3.0, with a release candidate coming out any minute now.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to celebrate WordPress\u2019s birthday with us \u2014 tell a friend! Help them upgrade their blog or find the perfect theme. Talk about how WordPress is built by and for a community. Drop in to help test 3.0, including all the plugins you use. Write something to take advantage of the new 3.0 features, or teach your friends how to. If you buy any themes or plugins, make sure they\u2019re GPL or compatible just like WordPress. We\u2019ve got a long road ahead of us, it\u2019s important that we not forget that Open Source got us this far, and is the only way we\u2019re going to get to the next level. The whole of what we can build together is far greater than the sum of our parts. Spread the good word. \ud83d\ude42</p>"},

Previously, we thought only 10% of sites were up-to-date. By excluding sites that are no longer online we were able to improve these statistics.</li>\n<li>We were able to clear up the data around WordPress 3.0, bringing it more in line with expectations.

{"title": "RSS Fixed", "content": "<p>This is just a quick post to let everyone know that the RSS for this development blog has been fixed. We\u2019ve been so busy adding great features to WordPress that it must have just slipped under the radar. On that I\u2019d like to bring this blog back to more what it was originally intended: an informal constant stream of news regarding WordPress development. Things have been quiet here but there has been a ton of progress happening. Just a quick summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New options system, never edit a configuration file again.</li>\n<li>Full Blogger API and MetaWeblog API; partial MT API support (so tools like <a href=\"http://zempt.com/\">Zempt</a> work)</li>\n<li>Numerous improvements to the administration interface</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That\u2019s just a peek. Right now I\u2019m working on multiple category support and the last \u201cmust-have\u201d feature before we put out the release is password-protected posts. What else? The Movable Type import is basically done, I just want to get multiple categories working first so no information is lost in the transition. There are a few other improvements underway that will most likely be in the next release, including quicktag improvements and some geographical integration but I\u2019ll post more on that later. When? Good question, hard to say. The time we devote to the project can vary from week to week depending on, well, life. However I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and guess that there will be a good beta out in about a week, and the release will follow after any bugs are worked out.</p>\n<p>To address the dev blog problem, I am going to at the very least post development updates every weekend, even if it\u2019s just to say that nothing has happened.</p>"},

For those not familiar with what a wiki is it\u2019s basically a content management system where everyone can edit all the content. It sounds chaotic but if anyone vandalizes the site it only takes a click to restore it to how it was. Wikis can be great for collecting information, and we plan to use it to develop some of the <a href=\"/docs/\">documentation</a>. So go have a look around, make a page for yourself, kick the tires. Thanks to the wp-docs group that talked me into finally getting a public wiki up.</p>"},

{"title": "Spam: Kill it at the root", "content": "<p>\n<a href=\"http://ma.tt/\">Matt</a> and I were chatting briefly earlier today about blog comment spam, and about <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/11/15/more-spam\">an article</a> that <a href=\"http://diveintomark.org/\">Mark Pilgrim</a> posted on his site. Mark is pretty pessimistic about the outlook for anti-comment-spam efforts. And he points out the great lengths to which spammers will go in order to get their spams out to where eyeballs will see them. Both usenet and email are awash with the refuse of spammers, because for some reason, <a href=\"http://spam.gunters.org/index.html?p=198&amp;c=1\">there are people out there who respond to their messages</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, I, like <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1647.html\">Sam Ruby</a>, believe that the outlook isn\u2019t quite as grim for blogs as it has been for usenet and email. Blogs are fundamentally different in how they work and in how people use them.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt was easy for spammers to abuse <a href=\"http://networking.webopedia.com/TERM/U/USENET.html\">usenet</a>, because it is a <a href=\"http://networking.webopedia.com/TERM/S/store_and_forward.html\">store-and-forward</a> system designed specifically for distributing messages to a large number of leaf nodes. You post a message into a newsgroup, and your message is replicated around the world, on thousands of other usenet servers, viewed by millions of users. Clients and servers speak a simple protocol, <a href=\"http://www.academ.com/academ/nntp/index.html\">NNTP</a>, and though most servers these days require authentication before you can post a message, there are still open servers to be found, if you know how to look.\n</p>\n<p>\nLikewise, email is a store-and-forward system, with a method of relaying messages from one server to another. Unlike usenet, email is designed to deliver messages directly to a particluar person, which makes it slightly less efficient for reaching large numbers of users. But only slightly, because it\u2019s quite easy to specify multiple recipients for a message. So the spammer can deliver a single message to a server, and instruct the server to deliver it to hundreds of different people. And again, many modern servers attempt to prevent unauthorized users from relaying messages, but there are still plenty of <a href=\"http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci782509,00.html\">vulnerable servers</a> on the internet that the spammers can find.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe relative ease and extreme low cost of reaching large numbers of consumers have made usenet and email into juicy targets for spammers. Low-hanging fruit, if you will. Spammers have also targeted other services, such as <a href=\"http://www.computercops.biz/article4094.html\">instant messaging</a> services, pagers, <a href=\"http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/features/CONSUMER/101503_fs_cell_phone_spam.html\">cell phones</a>, and more recently, blogs.\n</p>\n<p>\nObviously, I have a great interest in the problem of spam on blogs. I run <a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/\">multiple</a> <a href=\"http://spam.gunters.org/\">personal</a> <a href=\"http://www.gunters.org/\">blogs</a>, and I\u2019m a developer for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> blogging software. Spammers have hit my blogs on multiple occassions recently, and I delete the spam comments as soon as I become aware of them. But automating the process to some degree would certainly allow me to relax more. Fortunately, blogs are fundamentally different from usenet and email in several ways, and I think that these differences may allow us to stop this spam problem before it really gets bad. There\u2019s still a chance for us to kill this weed at the root, before it has a chance to grow.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhy do spammers post comments on blogs? Do they really expect blog owners to leave their comments up for people to read? Do they expect people to follow their links to the spammers\u2019 sites selling viagra and porn? Not really. What they are really after is <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GoogleJuice\">search engine ranking</a>. Because the more links to their sites that a search engine sees, the better the chance that their site will come up in a list of search results. Even if you\u2019ve deleted the original comment, it won\u2019t matter, if a search engine has already indexed the links in the comment before you deleted it. So, <strong>one</strong> of our anti-spam tactics should be to <a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/spamtest/\">bust up the search engine ranking</a> for spammers links.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd once a spammer has given us the link to his page and we see it for what it is, we can store that information in a blacklist, and use it to block future messages that try to link to that site. And if we can make a common, distributed, authenticated way to <a href=\"http://blam.sourceforge.net/\">share such blacklist info</a>, we can be pretty effective at staunching the flow of the spam. And if we can team up now, while this problem is still young, we can basically create an environment where comment spam just isn\u2019t cost-effective for the spammers.</p>"},

Robin tracked it down to a duplicate <code>body</code> selector that wasn\u2019t really needed so I removed it and the problem seems to have gone away. It was obviously a bug in Mozilla\u2019s rendering engine but it seems to be fixed in the newer versions already.

It also makes it much easier to collaborate with other developers, should you choose to.</p>\n<p>At this point the Plugin Repository is mainly aimed at developers and more savvy users, but if you can find your way around the interface it will prove a very powerful resource. Trac makes it simple to <a href=\"http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/TracBrowser\">browse the plugins</a> and download the latest version, and if the interest that has been shown so far by the WordPress hacker community is any indication, the repository is where the action is gonna be.
