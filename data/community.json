{"title": "People of WordPress: Amanda Rush", "content": "<p><em>You\u2019ve probably heard that WordPress is open source software, and may know that it\u2019s created and run by volunteers. WordPress enthusiasts share many examples of how WordPress changed people\u2019s lives for the better. This monthly series shares some of those lesser-known, amazing stories.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Meet Amanda Rush from Augusta, Georgia, USA.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amanda Rush is a WordPress advocate with a visual disability. She first started using computers in 1985, which enabled her to turn in homework to her sighted teachers. Screen reader technology for Windows was in its infancy then, so she worked in DOS almost exclusively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduating high school, Amanda went to college to study computer science, programming with DOS-based tools since compilers for Windows were still inaccessible. As part of her computer science course of study, she learned HTML which began her career in web development.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Amanda got started with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amanda began maintaining a personal website, and eventually began publishing her own content using LiveJournal. However, controlling the way the page around her content looked was hard, and she soon outgrew the hosted solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in 2005, Amanda bought customerservant.com, set up a very simple CMS for blogging, and started publishing there. She accepted the lack of design and content, and lack of easy customization because she wasn\u2019t willing to code her own solution. Nor did she want to move to another hosted solution, as she liked being able to customize her own site, as well as publish content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Hebrew dates led her to WordPress</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point, Amanda was looking for an easy way to display the Hebrew dates alongside the Gregorian dates on her blog entries. Unfortunately, the blogging software she was using at the time, did not offer customization options at that level. She decided to research alternative solutions and came across a WordPress plugin that did just that.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that WordPress would not keep her locked into a visual editor, used themes to customize styling, and offered ways to mark up content, immediately appealed to Amanda. She decided to give it a go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Accessibility caused her to dive deeper</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the software Amanda used at work became completely inaccessible, she started learning about WordPress. While she was learning about this new software, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0\">Web 2.0</a> was introduced. The lack of support for it in the screen reader she used meant that WordPress administration was completely inaccessible. To get anything done, Amanda needed to learn to find her way in WordPress\u2019 file structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually Amanda started working as an independent contractor for the largest screen reader developer in the market, Freedom Scientific. She worked from home every day and hacked on WordPress after hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately Amanda hit a rough patch when her job at Freedom Scientific ended. Using her savings she undertook further studies for various Cisco and Red Hat certifications, only to discover that the required testing for these certifications were completely inaccessible. She could study all she wanted, but wasn\u2019t able to receive grades to pass the courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She lost her financial aid, her health took a turn for the worse, she was diagnosed with Lupus, and lost her apartment. Amanda relocated to Augusta where she had supportive friends who offered her a couch and a roof over her head.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>But Amanda refused to give up</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Amanda continued to hack WordPress through all of this. It was the only stable part of her life. She wanted to help make WordPress accessible for people with disabilities, and in 2012 joined the\u00a0 WordPress Accessibility Team. Shortly after that, she finally got her own place to live, and started thinking about what she was going to do with the rest of her working life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listening to podcasts led her to take part in <a href=\"http://wordsesh.org/\">WordSesh</a>, which was delivered completely online and enabled Amanda to participate without needing to travel. She began to interact with WordPress people on Twitter, and continued to contribute to the community as part of the WordPress Accessibility Team. Things had finally started to pick up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Starting her own business</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, Amanda officially launched her own business, <a href=\"http://www.customerservant.com/\">Customer Servant Consultancy</a>. Since WordPress is open source, and becoming increasingly accessible, Amanda could modify WordPress to build whatever she wanted and not be at the mercy of web and application developers who know nothing about accessibility. And if she got stuck, she could tap into the community and its resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Improving her circumstances and becoming more self-sufficient means Amanda was able to take back some control over her life in general. She was able to gain independence and create her own business despite being part of the blind community, which has an 80% unemployment rate.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her own words:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>We\u2019re still fighting discrimination in the workplace, and we\u2019re still fighting for equal access when it comes to the technology we use to do our jobs. But the beauty of WordPress and its community is that we can create opportunities for ourselves.</em></p><p><em>I urge my fellow blind community members to join me inside this wonderful thing called WordPress. Because it will change your lives if you let it.</em></p><cite>Amanda Rush, entrepreneur</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/heropress_large_white_logo-1.jpg?fit=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7026\" width=\"110\" height=\"83\"></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This #ContributorStory post is based on an article originally published on HeroPress.com, a community initiative created by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">Topher DeRosia</a>.

{"title": "WordCamp Incubator 2.0", "content": "<p><a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamps</a> are informal, community-organized events that are put together by a team of local WordPress users who have a passion for growing their communities. They are born out of active WordPress meetup groups that meet regularly and are able to host an annual WordCamp event. This has worked very well in many communities, with over 120 WordCamps being hosted around the world in 2017.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes though, passionate and enthusiastic community members can\u2019t pull together enough people in their community to make a WordCamp happen. To address this, we introduced <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2016/02/experiment-wordcamp-incubator/\">the WordCamp Incubator program</a> in 2016.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of the incubator program is <strong>to help spread WordPress to underserved areas by providing more significant organizing support for their first WordCamp event.</strong> In 2016, members of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">the global community team</a> worked with volunteers in three cities \u2014 Denpasar, Harare and Medell\u00edn \u2014 giving direct, hands-on assistance in making local WordCamps possible. All three of these WordCamp incubators <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/30/wordcamp-incubator-report/\">were a great success</a>, so we're bringing the incubator program back for 2018.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where should the next WordCamp incubators be? If you have always wanted a WordCamp in your city but haven\u2019t been able to get a community started, this is a great opportunity. We will be taking applications for the next few weeks, then will get in touch with everyone who applied to discuss the possibilities. We will announce the chosen cities by the end of March.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To apply, </strong><a href=\"https://wordcampcentral.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-program-2018-city-application\"><strong>fill in the application</strong></a><strong> by March 15, 2018.</strong> You don\u2019t need to have any specific information handy, it\u2019s just a form to let us know you\u2019re interested. You can apply to nominate your city even if you don\u2019t want to be the main organizer, but for this to work well we will need local liaisons and volunteers, so please only nominate cities where you live or work so that we have at least one local connection to begin.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We're looking forward to hearing from you!<br></p>"},

{"title": "Becoming Better Digital Citizens Through Open Source", "content": "<p>The WordPress Project is on a mission to democratize publishing. As WordPress empowers more people to participate in the digital space, we have the opportunity to make sure that everyone can participate safely and responsibly. Today marks the start of Digital Citizenship Week. We will share how open source can be used as a tool for learners of all ages to practice and model being a positive digital citizen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is digital citizenship?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The digital landscape constantly changes and this affects the way we use the internet. New platforms emerge, people find different ways to spread information, communities form, grow and fade away every day. The concepts and practice of promoting civil discourse, critical thinking and safe use of the internet still remain central. And that is exactly what digital citizenship is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cPut simply, digital citizenship is a lot like citizenship in any other community \u2014 the knowledge of how to engage with digital communities you\u2019re part of in a way that is thoughtful, safe, and makes appropriate use of the technology.\u201d</em></p><cite><em>Josepha Haden, Executive Director of the WordPress Project</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who is a digital citizen?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital Citizenship is for all age groups. Anyone who uses the internet on a computer, mobile device or a TV is a digital citizen. You don\u2019t have to be tech-savvy already, maybe you are taking your first steps with technology. Digital Citizenship Week is a chance to reflect together on our impact on the digital world. It can help us to make our consumption more considered and our interaction friendlier. It enables us to make a positive difference to those around us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of us can strive (or learn) to become better digital citizens. It can be affected by the access those teaching have had to digital skills and good practice. Adult education classes and community tech hubs play a part in basic tech skill development. Unfortunately, these are not always accessible to those in less populated geographic locations.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source communities like WordPress already make a difference in encouraging the principles of digital citizenship, from sharing tech skills to improving security knowledge. They give people an opportunity to learn alongside their peers and many of the resources are available regardless of location, resources, or skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WordPress Meetups \u2013 locally-based, informal learning sessions which typically take place monthly on weekday evenings</li><li>WordCamps are city-based conferences that take place in cities worldwide. These events usually last 1-3 days and are organized and run by volunteers</li><li>The talks are also recorded and made available on the free, online library <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress.tv</a>. These can be watched from the comfort of your own home, office or during informal get-togethers</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>What can we do as part of the WordPress community?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital citizenship skills, like many other skills needed in this tech-focused world, should be kept up-to-date. Open source communities offer unparalleled opportunities to do this and are available in countries across the world. As part of our role as members of WordPress and other communities, we can pass on such skills to others. For instance by working alongside people who have had limited experience of digital skills. Or by finding new ways of making this knowledge sharing fun and accessible.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A few of the ways we do and can make an even greater difference:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>as bloggers and writers, we can be more aware of how to write content responsibly</li><li>as designers, we can think more about how different people will view, understand and respond to the designs and visuals we create or use</li><li>as developers, we can build systems that make it easier for all users to find information and accomplish their goals, to be secure while visiting our sites, and to model good security and practice</li><li>as community members, through organizing events like <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress\">WordPress Meetups</a> and <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org\">WordCamps</a>, we are helping equip those who may not have had access to digital literacy or who lack the confidence to put it into place or share with their family and colleagues. Through these events, the online videos and other resources on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress.tv</a> and through the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">Make WordPress teams</a>, we are already making a difference every day</li><li>as individuals, the way we communicate in the community and listen to each other is equally important. This is a vital part of how we grow and model positive digital citizens. Through growing our positive digital skills and a better understanding of online etiquette and challenges, we can make our immediate and wider digital world a more positive and useful environment</li><li>making it easier to document and share knowledge</li><li>emphasizing how skills learned within the community can be used in other parts of our digital lives</li><li>creating and becoming ambassadors for Digital Citizenship</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also get involved with specific events that have grown out of the wider WordPress project, championed by enthusiasts and those wanting to improve specific digital skills and bring wider benefits to society.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Community-driven Events</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org\"><strong>WordPress Translation Day</strong></a> in 2019 had 81 local events worldwide. Running for 24-hours, individuals with language skills translated aspects of the platform into multiple languages with a total of 1181 projects modified. An amazing 221 new translators joined on the day. In addition, there was a live stream with talks, panel discussions, interviews, and sharing of tips and skills to help others learn how to translate.

In addition to that, Alice wasn\u2019t that keen on having the same job all her life, as her parents had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Orru was 22 she moved to Siena, Tuscany, to finish her studies. That is when she created her first personal blog. The website was built on an Italian platform named Tiscali, which she later migrated to WordPress.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After 2 years in Tuscany Orru moved to Strasbourg, France. She studied French and worked several jobs while living there. Her first serious job was in Milan \u2013 working 40 hours/week in the marketing department of a large, international company. She found herself surrounded by ambitious colleagues and a boss who constantly requested extra \u2014unpaid\u2014 working hours per day.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/IMG_2672.jpg?fit=632%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Alice Orru\" class=\"wp-image-7291\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/IMG_2672.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/IMG_2672.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/IMG_2672.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/IMG_2672.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/IMG_2672.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/IMG_2672.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\"><figcaption>Alice Orru</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Choices, choices, choices\u2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alice gave up blogging because she wasn\u2019t feeling inspired enough to write. She questioned whether she really wanted to do that job forever; working 10 hours per day under the neon lights of an office. It forced her to set aside her dreams for the time being, and for a while, she mainly lived for the weekends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alice decided to leave the job and moved to Barcelona, Spain, all by herself, in 2012.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few months of intense Spanish learning at the university, she found a job in an international clinic as a \u201cPatient Coordinator.\u201d Orru assisted international patients coming to Barcelona for their treatments. She acted as their translator, interpreter and administrative consultant.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patients came from Italy, France, England, Morocco, Senegal, and several other countries. Alice was so inspired by some of their stories, that she started to write again: She dusted off her WordPress blog and filled it with stories about her new life in Barcelona and some of the women she met at the clinic. \u201cI was feeling stronger and more independent than ever,\u201d Orru expressed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Technical issues led to unexpected opportunities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the summer of 2015, Alice was writing on her blog and got stuck with a technical problem. While she was searching through the WordPress.com documentation, she saw a pop-up in the bottom right corner of her screen. It was a staff member of Automattic, checking if she needed help. They chatted for a few minutes and the problem was solved. Alice left the chat with one question, though: how did that person on chat find a support job with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alice found the official WordPress job page: <a href=\"http://jobs.wordpress.net/\"><strong>jobs.wordpress.net</strong></a> and noticed a job offer that caught her attention: WP Media, a French startup, was looking for a polyglot and remote customer service teammate for one of their plugins, WP Rocket. She read their requirements: fluency in English, French and possibly other languages, excellent experience with WordPress, and some coding skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She knew she didn\u2019t meet all the requirements, but could speak 4 languages, and she had a WordPress blog. She didn\u2019t know anything about PHP, though. Orru had been a WordPress.com user for years and knew she was ready to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Orru wrote a cover letter and sent her CV. A Skype interview was conducted and several days later she received the news that she had gotten the job!\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A steep learning curve</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The early days in her new job were intense. Alice felt inexperienced but was supported by her teammates. She started studying and reading everything about WordPress for beginners. Initially, she answered easy tickets from customers. All the while her teammates were sending useful material to read, setting up video-calls for 1 to 1 training, and encouraging her the entire time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, Orru was replying to customers whose first language was either Spanish or Italian in their native language. This was much appreciated and resulted in several happy comments. Until that moment the plugin\u2019s support had been offered only in English and French.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Finding her way in the WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Paris 2016, one of Alice\u2019s teammates introduced her to how the WordPress community collaborated and kept in contact through Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou speak multiple languages, why don\u2019t you try to contribute to the polyglots team?\u201d he asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alice knew very little about contributing to WordPress. She had only been working for WP Media for 6 months and didn\u2019t feel ready to dive into a new challenge and start also contributing to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, curiosity led her to join both the local Italian and the global WordPress Community on Slack. For the first few months, she mainly observed what was happening the channels. Then, she attended WordCamp Milan and met some members of the Italian Polyglots team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was love at first string! Laura, one of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/?locale=it_IT\"><strong>General Translation Editors</strong></a> (GTE) for Italy, taught her how to start contributing and translating, following the polyglots guidelines. She also told her about the Italian community\u2019s big efforts to work together, consistently, to boost and grow WordPress related events in Italy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her teammates\u2019 encouragement, Orru applied to WordCamps as a speaker and gave her first talk in December 2016 at WordCamp Barcelona. After that, she both spoke at WordCamp Torino on April 2017 and at WordCamp Europe in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/aliceorru-wordcamp-europe.jpg?fit=632%2C356&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7292\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/aliceorru-wordcamp-europe.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/aliceorru-wordcamp-europe.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/aliceorru-wordcamp-europe.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/aliceorru-wordcamp-europe.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\"><figcaption>Alice Orru speaking at WordCamp Europe, in Paris, in 2017</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Dreams evolve, all the time!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Orru knows that her experiences are not just due to luck.

{"title": "People of WordPress: Abdullah Ramzan", "content": "<p><em>You\u2019ve probably heard that WordPress is open-source software, and may know that it\u2019s created and run by volunteers. WordPress enthusiasts share many examples of how WordPress changed people\u2019s lives for the better. This monthly series shares some of those lesser-known, amazing stories.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Meet Abdullah Ramzan, from Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Abdullah Ramzan was born and brought up in the under-developed city of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layyah\"><strong>\u200bLayyah\u200b</strong></a>, which is situated in Southern Punjab, Pakistan and surrounded by desert and the river \u200bSindh\u200b.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He graduated from college in his home town and started using a computer in \u200b2010\u200b when he joined <a href=\"https://gcuf.edu.pk/\"><strong>\u200bGovernment College University Faisalabad\u200b</strong></a>. Abdullah\u2019s introduction to WordPress happened while he was finishing the last semester of his degree. His final project was based in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ramzan\u2019s late mother was the real hero in his life, helping him with his Kindergarten homework and seeing him off to school every day.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before her heart surgery, Ramzan visited her in the hospital ICU, where she hugged him and said: \u200b\u201c<strong>Don\u2019t worry, everything will be good</strong>.\u201d Sadly, his mother died during her surgery. However, her influence on Ramzan\u2019s life continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Start of Ramzan\u2019s Career:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduation, Ramzan struggled to get his first job. He first joined PressTigers<strong>\u200b</strong> as a Software Engineer and met Khawaja Fahad Shakeel<a href=\"https://twitter.com/FahadShakeel\"><strong>\u200b</strong></a>, his first mentor. Shakeel provided Ramzan with endless support. Something had always felt missing in his life, but he felt like he was on the right track for the first time in his life when he joined the WordPress community.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community \u2013 WordCamps and Meetups:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Ramzan had used WordPress since \u200b2015\u200b, attending WordPress meetups and open source contributions turned out to be a game-changer for him. He learned a lot from the WordPress community and platform, and developed strong relationships with several individuals. One of them is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jainnidhi03\"><strong>\u200b</strong></a>Nidhi Jain\u200b from Udaipur India who he works with on WordPress development. The second is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/desrosj\"><strong>\u200b</strong></a>Jonathan Desrosiers\u200b who he continues to learn a lot from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Usman Khalid<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Usman__Khalid\"><strong>\u200b</strong></a>, the lead organizer of WC Karachi, mentored Ramzan, helping him to develop his community skills.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the mentorship of these contributors, Ramzan is confident supporting local WordPress groups and helped to organize \u200bWordCamp Karachi\u200b, where he spoke for the first time at an international level event. He believes that WordPress has contributed much to his personal identity.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/09/AbdullahRamzan.jpeg?resize=632%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Abdullah Ramzan among a group of community members at WordCamp Karachi 2018\" class=\"wp-image-7088\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/09/AbdullahRamzan.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/09/AbdullahRamzan.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/09/AbdullahRamzan.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/09/AbdullahRamzan.jpeg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/09/AbdullahRamzan.jpeg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/09/AbdullahRamzan.jpeg?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Abdullah Ramzan at WordCamp Karachi 2018</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WordPress and the Future:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Lahore/members/?op=leaders&amp;sort=name\"><strong>\u200bco-organizer of WordPress Meetup Lahore,\u200b</strong></a> he would love to involve more people in the community leadership team, to provide a platform for people to gather under one roof, to learn and share something with each other. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he has loftier ambitions. Impressed by <a href=\"https://walktowc.eu/\">Walk to WordCamp Europe</a>, Abdullah is seriously considering walking to WordCamp Asia. He also one day hopes for the opportunity to serve his country as a senator of Pakistan<a href=\"http://www.senate.gov.pk/\"><strong>\u200b</strong></a> and intends to enter the next senate election.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Words of Encouragement</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Abdullah Ramzan knows there is no shortcut to success. \u201cYou have to work hard to achieve your goals,\u201d explained Ramzan. He still has much he wishes to accomplish and hopes to be remembered for his impact on the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abdullah believes WordPress can never die as long as people don\u2019t stop innovating to meet new demands. The beauty of WordPress is that it is made for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ramzan encouraged, \u201cIf you seriously want to do something for yourself, do something for others first. Go for open source, you\u2019ll surely learn how to code. You\u2019ll learn how to work in a team. Join local meetups, meet with the folks: help them, learn from them, and share ideas.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/heropress_large_white_logo.jpg?resize=109%2C82&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7025\" width=\"109\" height=\"82\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/heropress_large_white_logo.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/heropress_large_white_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/heropress_large_white_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 109px) 100vw, 109px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This #ContributorStory post is based on an article originally published on HeroPress.com, a community initiative created by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">Topher DeRosia</a>.

{"title": "Responsible Participation In Online Communities", "content": "<p>In our <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/10/becoming-better-digital-citizens-through-open-source/\">first article in this series</a>, we highlighted the WordPress mission to democratize publishing. WordPress introduced a tool to independent and small publishers who did not have the resources of the larger publishing platforms. Access to a free content management system to create websites has empowered thousands of people to find their voice online. People have been able to share their enthusiasm for hobbies, causes, products and much more. Through these different voices, we can encourage understanding, spark creativity, and create environments where collaboration can happen. But as we build more digital communities, it\u2019s easy to forget that online safety is a group effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital literacy is also part of being a good digital citizen, but it\u2019s more than just being able to do basic actions with your mobile device. Digital literacy refers to the range of skills needed to do online research, set up web accounts, and find solutions for fixing devices among other things. But to be able to enjoy more of the digital world safely and responsibly \u2013 to be a good digital citizen \u2013 we need to be able to:\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>navigate</strong> vast amounts of information without getting overwhelmed;</li><li><strong>evaluate</strong> a variety of perspectives;</li><li><strong>connect</strong> with people with respect and empathy;</li><li><strong>create</strong>, curate and share information.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We will need our offline analytical and social skills to make that happen.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Some best practices our community members have shared!</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Online or offline, let empathy be your compass</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The hardest part about all of this is the anonymity of online interactions. Without that face-to-face feedback of saying something mean to another person\u2019s face, it\u2019s easy to upset the people you\u2019re trying to communicate with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our daily lives in the offline world, comments may be more tempered and slow to anger\u00a0 in disagreements. Visual cues will help us determine how a remark is perceived. That, in turn, helps us adjust our behaviour Action, reaction, it\u2019s how we learn best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online, however, the experience is different. A keyboard does not protest if we type angry, hate-filled messages. A screen does not show any signs of being hurt. The lack of physical human presence combined with the anonymity of online alter-egos can be a formula for disrespectful and unfriendly behavior. It is good to remind ourselves that behind the avatars, nicknames and handles are real people. The same empathy we display in our in-person interactions should apply online as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Critically evaluate your sources\u00a0</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We all have times when we consume information with limited research and fact-checking. For some of us, it feels like there\u2019s no time to research and compare sources when faced by a sea of online information. For others, there may be uncertainty about where to start and what to consider. But, without a bit of skepticism and analytical thinking, we run the risk of creating narrow or incorrect understanding of the world. With a little effort we can curb the sharing of fake news and biased information, particularly on topics that are new to us or that we\u2019re not familiar with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Misinformation can spread like wildfire. Ask these simple questions to evaluate information online:\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>who is the source of the information?</li><li>is it plausible?</li><li>is the information fact or just an opinion?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Own our content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this day and age, it\u2019s never been easier to just copy, paste and publish somebody else\u2019s content. That doesn\u2019t mean that we should! Publishing content that is not truly \u2018yours\u2019 in wording and tone of voice is unlikely to build a connection with the right audience. But, just as important, using someone else\u2019s content may breach copyright and potentially intellectual property rights.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about intellectual property, <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/about-ip/en/\">visit the World Intellectual Property Organization website</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Don\u2019t breeze past terms and conditions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever signed up for an online service (to help you distribute published content or accept payments) that was offered at no cost? In our fast-paced digital lives, we tend to want to breeze past terms and conditions or warning information and often miss important information about what will happen with our data.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we are given a contract on paper, we tend to read and re-read it, giving it a greater priority of our time. We may send it to other people for a second opinion or seek further review before signing. Remarkably, we rarely do that with online agreements. As a result, we may be putting our online privacy and security at risk. (WordPress uses a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/gpl-primer/\">GPL license</a>, and only collects usage data that we never share ever.).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Keep your website safe and healthy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to own your voice online, you also need to protect your reputation by securing your publishing platform. Websites can face security attacks. Hackers may seek to obtain access through insecure settings, outdated plugins and old software versions, and in extreme cases can try to scam your visitors. And leaking customer data, may even lead to legal consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, websites \u2018flagged\u2019 for security issues, can lead to high bounce rates and eventual loss of search rankings. This can all affect how search engines rate or even block your site.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good practices to keep your website safe include changing your safe password regularly, installing security software, an SSL certificate and keeping the core software, plugins and themes up to date. This will not guarantee that you will keep hackers out, so always keep several backups of your site, ideally both offline and online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is just website security in a tiny nutshell. If you would like to learn more about keeping websites safe, you may want to check out some of these resources and many more videos at WordPress.tv.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Join in and help make the web a better place!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of Digital Citizenship Week, we would like to encourage you to learn and share skills with your colleagues, friends and family members. That way, we all become more informed of potential issues and how to reduce the risks. Together we can make it easier to navigate the web more effectively and securely!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional resources</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Site health check</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 introduced pages in the admin interface to help users run health checks on their sites.

Digital literacy can vary between ages but there are lots of ways different generations can work together and empower each as digital citizens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter whether you\u2019re a parent or caregiver, teacher or mentor, it\u2019s hard to know the best way to teach younger generations the skills needed to be an excellent digital citizen. If you\u2019re not confident about your own tech skills, you may wonder how you can help younger generations become savvy digital citizens. But using technology responsibly is about more than just technical skills. By collaborating across generations, you can also strengthen all your family members\u2019 skills, and offer a shared understanding of what the internet can provide and how to use it to help your neighborhoods and wider society.\u00a0<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Taking Gen Z Beyond Digital Savvy</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Open up the dialogue</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you\u2019re not fully confident in your own tech skills, you can help develop digital citizenship skills in others. If you feel comfortable during everyday conversation, you could describe a tech situation you have come across and ask family members if they have ever experienced something similar. You can give them a chance to share how they handled it or how it made them feel. This can help encourage them to think critically and to react with empathy. And being asked for advice can make them feel appreciated and empowered. But opening up the conversation can also be as simple as asking if they\u2019ve seen anything online lately that they found interesting or wanted to talk about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Share access to free and affordable training</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source content management systems have made online publishing accessible to a more diverse group of people. Dozens of content platforms offer hands-on training at no or low cost. <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress.tv</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/wordpress\">LinkedIn Learning</a>, and others have low-cost video libraries with thousands of recorded talks and workshops and the WordPress Training team have excellent downloadable lesson plans and materials. These platforms not only feature content that helps develop tech and content creation skills but also content around ethics, diversity and community building.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Find a sense of community and belonging</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the disadvantages of increased digitalization is that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/\">younger generations and us all may spend less time hanging out in-person.</a> Digital time spent with others is no replacement for in-person interactions. The awareness and mutual understanding which comes from back and forth interaction is needed for positive interpersonal skills. This is hard to replace in digital communities and those skills can only be learned with lots of hands-on practice.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Learn the many benefits of volunteering\u00a0</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are WordPress events across the world that provide a great place to learn new skills to share with your families and friends. Some work with schools and colleges to offer special events which are open to all ages. There are also plenty of small ways to volunteer with the WordPress project that can be done at home to practice new skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to attending events where you can learn skills and hang out with others with similar interests, the WordPress ecosystem offers countless opportunities to be actively involved. Professionals, hobbyists, and learners all make a difference by contributing to the ongoing creation of the WordPress platform. Together these people, who are known as contributors, form the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">WordPress open source community.</a>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>WordPress is created by volunteer contributors</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only are these contributors creating an amazingly flexible platform for all to use, it is an environment where you can continue to improve your skills, both technical and interpersonal. Open-source software projects can introduce you to people you would otherwise not get the chance to meet, locally and internationally. If you have a zest for learning, and for finding others to connect with, WordPress has many ways to meet contributors in person!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>WordPress events are organized by volunteers</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress community events are volunteer-run. This can be a great way to give back to the project and practice all sorts of skills. Talk to your local event about how you could get involved and if you would like to bring older teenagers and young adults with you. You will not need any pre-existing tech skills to attend these events but they are a great way to discover areas you might want to learn more about.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Contributor days offer a great opportunity to get involved</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>These events are specially designed to help you get involved in building the open-source WordPress platform. You can collaborate with other members of its community and find areas that are right for you to use and grow your skills. All of the tasks you will discover at an event can be continued at home and some are easy to get other family members involved in learning and adding in ideas.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors come from all sorts of backgrounds and locations, some may live near you and others thousands of miles away. Working alongside lots of different cultures and countries can open up new ideas for young people letting them learn new ways of doing things and discover different perspectives. All those different perspectives can cause misunderstandings. But being involved in a global learning community is a great way to practice communicating across cultural boundaries.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Getting involved can be rewarding in many (unexpected) ways</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The most rewarding part of actively taking part in WordPress events is making budding friendships. New connections often turn into long-lasting friendships that are likely to continue for years to come, both online and offline. With a global community, these friendships can potentially lead to lots of international adventures too!</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Getting ready for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordCampBTN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WordCampBTN</a>.

It can also help you make us make more informed decisions. The more we interact with a diverse range of people, the more empathic we become. Some of the most valuable learning that can be offered to Gen Z (and probably to all of us at times) is that what we come across in fast-moving digital communities isn\u2019t always the entire view.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>All things considered\u2026.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who is a digital native may not need encouragement to obtain tech skills. But they may not be aware that digital communities are still communities and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/10/responsible-participation-in-online-communities/\">we need to use the same sorts of people skills for both offline and online locations</a>. Opening up conversations about situations they may experience online that may require them to (re)act responsibly, can encourage them to think critically and act with empathy. Compared to previous generations, digital natives spend substantially more time by themselves while using devices, so encouraging them to join real-life communities, such as WordPress, could be the first step to learning what it means to be a good digital citizen!\u00a0 </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>webcommsat</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>chanthaboune</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/yvettesonneveld/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>yvettesonneveld</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annemariedh/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>annemariedh</a></p>"},

Kim was an active and well-loved member of the WordPress community. Unfortunately, she passed away in 2015.

She was often by herself, taking care of the property with only a few neighbors up and down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She received internet access from towers that broadcast wireless signals, similar to cell phones but at lower speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Connecting through attending live podcast recordings</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By listening to the regular podcast, WordPress Weekly, Kim met members of the WordPress community and was able to talk to them on a weekly basis. The show and its after-hours sessions provided Kim a chance to mingle with the who\u2019s who of WordPress at the time. It helped establish long-lasting relationships that would open up future opportunities for her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since she lived in a location where few around her used or had even heard of WordPress, the community was an opportunity for her to be with like-minded people. Kim enjoyed interacting with the community, both online and at WordCamp events, and many community members became her second family, a responsibility she took very seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cMany members of the WordPress community became her second family, a responsibility she took very seriously.\u201d</em></p><cite><em>Jeff Chandler</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>One of the first women of WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kim is regarded as one of the first \u201cwomen of WordPress,\u201d investing a lot of her time in women who wanted to break into tech.

WordPress enthusiasts share many examples of how WordPress changed people\u2019s lives for the better. This monthly series shares some of those lesser-known, amazing stories.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Meet Jill Binder</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jill Binder never meant to become an activist. She insists it was an accident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite that, Jill has led the Diversity Outreach Speaker Training working group in the WordPress Community team since 2017. This group is dedicated to increasing the number of women and other underrepresented groups who are stepping up to become speakers at WordPress Meetups, WordCamps, and events.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Jill\u2019s back story</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Internship</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Jill\u2019s WordPress story begins in 2011, in Vancouver, Canada.\u00a0Jill secured an internship for her college program, working on a higher education website that was built in WordPress.\u00a0As a thank you, her practicum advisor bought Jill a ticket to WordCamp Vancouver 2011: Developer\u2019s Edition. After that Jill began freelancing\u00a0 with WordPress as a Solopreneur.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>First steps in the WordPress community</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The following year her internship advisor, who had become a client, was creating the first ever BuddyCamp for BuddyPress. He asked Jill to be on his organizing team. At that event she also moderated a panel that had Matt Mullenweg on it. Then, Jill was invited to be on the core organizing team for WordCamp Vancouver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of this role meant reviewing and selecting speakers. From 40 speaker applications that could be a fit the team had to pick only 14 to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The diversity challenge when selecting speakers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone who has organized a conference, you know that speaker selection is hard. Of the 40 applications, 7 were from women, and the lead organizer selected 6 of those to be included in the speaker line up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point Jill wasn\u2019t aware that very few women apply to speak at tech conferences and suggested selection should be made on the best fit for the conference. The team shared that not only did they feel the pitches were good and fit the conference, but they also needed to be accepted or the Organizers would be criticized for a lack of diversity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Selecting women for fear of criticism is embarrassing to admit, but that\u2019s how people felt in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time the event happened, though, the number of women speakers dropped to 4. And with an additional track being added, the number of speakers overall was up to 28. Only 1 speaker in 7 was a woman (or 14%) and attendees did ask questions and even blogged about the lack of representation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What keeps women from applying?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Later that year at\u00a0 WordCamp San Francisco\u2014the biggest WordCamp at the time (before there was a WordCamp US)\u2014Jill took the opportunity to chat with other organizers about her experience. She found out that many organizers had trouble getting enough women to present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly Vancouver had a high number of women applicants in comparison to others, and the consensus was more would be accepted\u00a0 if only more would apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jill decided that she\u00a0 needed to know why this was happening? Why weren\u2019t there more women applying? She started researching, reading, and talking to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though this issue is complex, two things came up over and over:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>\u201cWhat would I talk about?\u201d</li><li>\u201cI\u2019m not an expert on anything. I don\u2019t know enough about anything to give a talk on it.\u201d</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A first workshop with encouraging results</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then Jill had an idea. She brought up the issue at an event and someone suggested that they should get women together in a room and brainstorm speaker topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Jill became the lead of a small group creating a workshop in Vancouver: the talented Vanessa Chu, Kate Moore Hermes, and Mandi Wise. In one of the exercises that they created, participants were invited to brainstorm ideas\u2014this proved that they had literally a hundred topic ideas and the biggest problem then became picking just one!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first workshop, they focussed on:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Why it matters that women (<em>added later: diverse groups</em>) are in the front of the room</li><li>The myths of what it takes to be the speaker at the front of the room (aka beating impostor syndrome)</li><li>Different presentation formats, especially story-telling</li><li>Finding and refining a topic</li><li>Tips to become a better speaker</li><li>Leveling up by speaking in front of the group throughout the afternoon</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-2.png?resize=600%2C400&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"women gathering to discussion presentation topics\" class=\"wp-image-8195\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-2.png?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-2.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Vancouver Workshop 2014</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Leading to workshops across North America and then the world</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Other cities across North America heard about the workshop and started hosting them, adding their own material.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many women who initially joined her workshop wanted help getting even better at public speaking. So Jill\u2019s Vancouver team added in some material created from the other cities and a bit more of their own. Such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Coming up with a great title</li><li>Writing a pitch that is more likely to get accepted</li><li>Writing a bio</li><li>Creating an outline</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Vancouver 2014\u2014only one year since Jill started\u2014there were 50% women speakers and 3 times the number of women applicants! Not only that, but this WordCamp was a Developer\u2019s Edition, where it\u2019s more challenging to find women developers in general, let alone those who will step up to speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>More work is needed!</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Impressive as those results were, the reason Jill is so passionate about this work is because of what happened next:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Some of the women who attended the workshop stepped up to be leaders in the community and created new content for other women.</li><li>A handful of others became WordCamp organizers. One year Vancouver had an almost all-female organizing team \u2013 5 out of 6!</li><li>It also influenced local businesses. One local business owner loved what one of the women speakers said so much that he hired her immediately. She was the first woman developer on the team, and soon after she became the Senior Developer.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Diversity touches on many levels</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jill has seen time and again what happens when different people speak at the front of the room. More people feel welcome in the community. The speakers and the new community members bring new ideas and new passions that help to make the technology we are creating more inclusive. And together we generate new ideas that benefit everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This workshop was so successful, with typical results of going from 10% to 40-60% women speakers at WordCamps, that the WordPress Global Community Team asked Jill to promote it and train it for women and all diverse groups around the world. In late 2017, Jill started leading the Diverse Speaker Training group (<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/wpdiversity/\">#wpdiversity</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dozens of community members across the world have now been trained to lead the workshop. With now dozens of workshops worldwide, for WordPress and other open source software projects as well, there is an increase in speaker diversity.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-3.png?fit=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Diverse Speaker Training group \" class=\"wp-image-8196\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-3.png?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-3.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-3.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-3.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-3.png?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-3.png?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-3.png?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\"><figcaption>WordCamp US 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of the success, Jill is now sponsored to continue the program.

Her dad was creating websites for a living at the time. She needed a website for her band because she wanted to be a rockstar. Under his training, and with a little bit of self-teaching, she learned how to build a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She had been aware of WordPress since 2005, and, in 2008 a client specifically hired her as a freelancer to develop a WordPress website. Kori went straight to Google and taught herself how to build a WordPress website over a single weekend. She really enjoyed the experience of working with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>My mind was absolutely blown when I saw the drag and drop options inside of menus to create dropdowns and a form builder.\u00a0</em></p><cite>Kori Ashton</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She suggested to her dad that WordPress could be a solution for their customers who wanted to be able to access their own websites. Previously, they had found this was not as easy for clients unless they had specific software and knew how to code. So, Kori and her dad worked to learn WordPress over the next few years.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then in 2012, Kori and her parents launched their new business, WebTegrity, in San Antonio, Texas, US. It started out small: just Kori and her parents. Soon, they started subcontracting design work and quickly continued to grow their team.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Going big time</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the business was in a saturated industry in San Antonio \u2014 over 700 freelancers and agencies were providing similar services \u2014  Kori and her parents were able to sell their company five years later, with a multi-million dollar valuation. There were a few choices they made early on that led to that success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. They picked a niche: WordPress specialists\u00a0</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, there were no WordPress-specific agencies in San Antonio. They emphasized the fact that WordPress was the only CMS their company would use. Prospective clients looking for a different type of CMS solution were not the right fit for their business. They also offered on-site, WordPress training and weekend workshops that were open to anyone (including other agencies) as one of their revenue streams. They soon were established as a city-wide WordPress authority.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. They cultivated a culture</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Kori wanted a great culture and environment in her company and to make that happen, she needed to hire the right people. She believes you must be careful about who you bring into the culture of your business, but particularly when hiring leaders into that community. You can\u2019t teach passion so you\u2019ve got to find people that are excited about what you do. You also need to look for integrity, creativity, a love for solving problems, and an eagerness to keep getting better.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>You can teach code all day long, but be sure to find people with the right hearts to join your community and then train them up the right way. This way you will grow your culture in a healthy way.</em></p><cite>Kori Ashton</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-2.png?resize=632%2C660&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8350\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-2.png?w=711&amp;ssl=1 711w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-2.png?resize=287%2C300&amp;ssl=1 287w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Kori and her two sons</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. They learned how to build sustainable revenue streams</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other web development agencies, WebTegrity started out with the \u201cone-time fee and you\u2019re done\u201d business model. This business model is known for unpredictable revenue streams. Hearing about recurring revenue business models at WordCamp Austin was a lightbulb moment for Kori. She started drafting a more sustainable business model on the way back home.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Support packages were key to their new business plan. Clients needed ongoing support. They decided to include at least 12 months of post-launch support into their web development projects. This doubled their revenue in one year and allowed them to even out their revenue streams.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. They knew the importance of reputation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Kori believes that every client, whether they have a $5,000 or a $50,000 budget, should get the same type of boutique-style, white glove, concierge relationship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every single project results in the absolute best solution for a client\u2019s needs. In addition to that, offering training helped boost their reputation. Explaining the lingo of the web development and SEO fields and showing the processes used, added transparency. It helped set and meet expectations and it built trust.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. They proactively gave back to the community</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Kori heard Matt Mullenweg speak about <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five For The Future</a> at WordCamp US. He encouraged people in the audience who make a living using WordPress, to find ways to give back 5% of their time to building the WordPress software and community. Matt talked about how firms and individuals could give back to the community. He suggested, for instance to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>start a WordPress Meetup group</li><li>present at a Meetup event\u00a0</li><li>facilitate a Meetup group where maybe you\u2019re just the organizer and you never have to speak because you\u2019re not a fan of speaking</li><li>help organize a WordCamp</li><li>volunteer at a WordCamp</li><li>write a tutorial and tell people how to do WordPress related things\u00a0</li><li>run a workshop</li><li>make a video</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1001\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?fit=632%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8351\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/02/kori-ashton-3.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\"><figcaption>If you\u2019re making an income using WordPress, consider giving 5% of your time back to building the software and/or the community.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This gave Kori another light bulb moment. She could make videos to give back. So her way to give back to the WordPress community is her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/webtegrity\">YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every Wednesday, she published a video on how to improve your online marketing. This made a huge impact, both inside the WordPress community, but also in her own business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Understanding</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in summary, how did Kori and her family turn their business into a multi-million dollar buyout in just five years?\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, it was about understanding that you have to build value. About keeping an exit strategy in mind while building your business. For instance when naming your company. Will it stand alone? Could it turn into a brand that you could sell as an independent entity?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Think about revenue streams and watch sales margins.</li><li>Be sure to include healthy margins.\u00a0</li><li>Don\u2019t hire until you have no further option.</li><li>Make sure to structure your offerings in such a way that you\u2019re actually recouping your value.\u00a0</li><li>Understand entrepreneurship, watch Shark Tank, read more tutorials, watch more videos.</li><li>Get involved in the WordPress community. Get to know its core leaders, the speakers that travel around to all the WordCamps. Start following them on Twitter and try to understand what they\u2019re sharing.\u00a0</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, the fact that Kori was so active in the San Antonio community helped enable the sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>We just kept hammering on the fact that we were the go-to place here in San Antonio for WordPress. We kept training, we kept doing free opportunities, going out and speaking at different events, and people kept seeing us.

{"title": "People of WordPress: Robert Cheleuka", "content": "<p><em>You\u2019ve probably heard that WordPress is open-source software, and may know that it\u2019s created and run by volunteers. WordPress enthusiasts share many examples of how WordPress changed people\u2019s lives for the better. This monthly series shares some of those lesser-known, amazing stories.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Meet Robert Cheleuka</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert is a self-taught graphic and motion designer turned web designer (and aspiring web developer) from Malawi, Africa. Over the years, he has grown fond of WordPress and has become a loyal user. Still, the journey is rough.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"790\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/01/DSC08818.jpg?resize=632%2C790&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Robert Cheleuka\" class=\"wp-image-8303\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Robert Cheleuka</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Malawi</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Malawi is one of the poorest countries in the world. A tiny landlocked country with a population of 17 million, it\u2019s largely rural and still considered a developing country. The average entry-level monthly pay for most skilled jobs is about $110. If you\u2019re employed full-time in the creative industry and if you\u2019re very lucky, you might be able to earn more than that. Employees earning more than $300 a month are rare to non-existent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert has been a freelance graphic designer since about 2011. He started by doing gigs from his dorm in college and from home. Earnings from his freelance jobs increased his interest in entrepreneurship and he started to consider starting his own creative agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How Robert was introduced to WordPress</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert first came into contact with WordPress in 2014 when he and a friend started a local tech blog. Before that, all he knew was basic, outdated HTML from high school and some knowledge of Adobe Dreamweaver.\u00a0They decided to use WordPress, and their new blog looked like it came from the future. They used a theme from the repo and got such positive feedback from the blog they decided to open a content and media publishing agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While they got a few web redesign jobs thanks to the exposure the blog brought, they lacked the administrative and business skills needed and ended up going their separate ways. Then in his first real job after college Robert finally took it upon himself to learn the ins and outs of WordPress. He learned how to install WordPress on a server and did some research on customizing themes.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that knowledge alone he got his first web design clients and started earning nearly as much as he did at his job. Robert soon realized that free WordPress themes would only take him so far, especially with his limited code skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because in Malawi only people who travel abroad have access to credit cards, paying for premium themes was impossible. Like many WordPress designers in developing countries, Robert turned to using pirated themes instead. He knew that was both unsafe and unethical, and decided to learn how to code. Knowing how to build themes from scratch would surely help him rise above the competition.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/01/20180905_1971270886435744_8835917058488139776_n.jpg?fit=632%2C632&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8304\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/01/20180905_1971270886435744_8835917058488139776_n.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/01/20180905_1971270886435744_8835917058488139776_n.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/01/20180905_1971270886435744_8835917058488139776_n.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/01/20180905_1971270886435744_8835917058488139776_n.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/01/20180905_1971270886435744_8835917058488139776_n.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The WordPress community from Robert\u2019s perspective</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert doesn\u2019t have a lot of interaction with the WordPress community. Although he would search for solutions from blogs about WordPress he had never actually talked to or asked anyone from the community for a solution.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert believes that this isolation is the result of a glass ceiling \u2014 the WordPress community is partially online and partially in-person, but there isn\u2019t a local group in Malawi. And because Malawi, like many other developing nations, lacks a way to pay online many can\u2019t access premium support, online learning, or most other types of professional development. No matter how welcoming the people of WordPress might be, it can still feel like it mostly belongs to those with enough privilege to conduct business on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>WordPress &amp; inclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As most freelancers know, it\u2019s really hard to learn while you also still need to earn. Add pitching to clients and shipping graphic design projects\u2026 there are only so many hours in a day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert didn\u2019t have a programming background and had always been more of a creative person. In order to grow as a web designer/developer, he needed to learn PHP. Again, without access to a credit card, that was complicated. Also, free coding training wasn\u2019t as widely available as it is now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert wishes that more developers would consider alternative ways for users who cannot pay for courses, themes, or plugins (whether that\u2019s because of available infrastructure or otherwise). He wishes that WordPress tutors and developers would open up ways to accommodate aspiring learners in developing countries who cannot access plugins, courses, and themes, to be able to give back and to participate at another level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has allowed him to build an income he would have no other way of earning and it makes a huge difference. He believes sharing stories like his will hopefully make WordPress products and services become more universally available. In addition, he hopes that more aspiring, self-taught developers will find courage in reaching out to connect with others out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contributors</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alison Rothwell (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpfiddlybits/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>wpfiddlybits</a>), Yvette Sonneveld (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/yvettesonneveld/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>yvettesonneveld</a>), Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>chanthaboune</a>), Siobhan Cunningham (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/siobhanseija/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>siobhanseija</a>), Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>topher1kenobe</a>). \u00a0Thank you to Robert Cheleuka  for sharing his #ContributorStory.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"474\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/heropress_large_white_logo.jpg?resize=632%2C474&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7025\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/heropress_large_white_logo.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/heropress_large_white_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/07/heropress_large_white_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<p> <em>This post is based on an article originally published on HeroPress.com, a community initiative created by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">Topher DeRosia</a>.

{"title": "2010 Open Source Design Plans", "content": "<p>2010 is the year we dive into open source design. We\u2019ve dipped our toes in this pool before (icon contest, graphic design component for Trac tickets, header refresh contest, etc.), but this year we\u2019re going to cannonball and make a big splash. Here\u2019s what you need to know if you want to get involved.</p>\n<p><strong>A list for all seasons. </strong>Developers have the <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-hackers\">wp-hackers mailing list</a> to discuss core and plugin code. Sometimes UI/UX stuff comes up and gets discussed there, but there is a whole universe of discussion around navigation labels, gradients, button styling, layouts, alignment, etc. that would be clutter on wp-hackers. Designers need a list to call their own, and now we have one. You can sign up for the <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-ui\">wp-ui list</a> to discuss ways to improve the interface or user experience of WordPress, and to discuss progress on design-related projects for the open source project, like the design challenges we\u2019re going to have.</p>\n<p><strong>Design Challenges.</strong> We learned a lot from the icon design and header refresh contests, and we want to do these kind of open design challenges on a regular basis to give UI/UX designers who want to contribute to the WordPress open source project more opportunities to do so. If we could do one per month, that would be ideal, keeping the challenges relatively bite-sized to allow potential contributors an easy way to get involved at first. As each challenge is posted, people can use the list to bounce ideas off each other and work toward optimal solutions. I\u2019m hoping the design challenges will evolve to be less contest and more collaboration. We\u2019ll announce the first one before the end of January, so if you\u2019re interested, please sign up for the list! <em>(Hint: one will likely be a touch up to the Right Now dashboard module, to improve the information design, and there will be a couple of screen layout challenges coming up as well.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Distributed Usability Testing.</strong><em> </em>We started to try this out last year, and several dozen usability professionals volunteered to help get the program going, but a combination of scheduling and infrastructure issues combined to stall the progress. Having the \u201cUI/UX contributor team\u201d infrastructure in place, starting with the mailing list, will make it much easier to get this project going again.</p>\n<p><strong>Chit-chat.</strong> The weekly developer chats in IRC at <a href=\"https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev\">#wordpress-dev</a> have been very productive. We\u2019ve created an IRC room at <a href=\"http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=wordpress-ui\">#wordpress-ui on irc.freenode.net</a> so that we can have the same kind of \u201cwater cooler\u201d for UI/UX contributors as for core code contributors. In addition to being a place where you can drop in and discuss core UI/UX (note: this room will not be a place to discuss the design of blog themes, it\u2019s to discuss the design of the WordPress application itself), we\u2019ll set up a weekly chat. Choosing a day and time for the chats will probably be the first discussion on the mailing list.</p>\n<p><strong>A blog of our own. </strong>Once again, taking a page from the code contributor infrastructure, we\u2019ll set up a blog for UI/UX updates, announcements, progress reports, etc. This will be on WordPress.org in the nearish future, and will be announced to the mailing list when it is live.</p>\n<p>So, if you want to become a contributor to core WordPress by using your design skills, <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-ui\">join the wp-ui mailing list</a> and get ready for a fun year!</p>"},
{"title": "Summer of WordPress 2010: Act II", "content": "<p><em>Scene: A college classroom</em></p>\n<p><strong>Professor: </strong>So. Out of the 20 students in the class, half wrote <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/gsoc\">WordPress Summer of Code</a> proposals good enough to receive an A. How many of you are planning to apply for the program?</p>\n<p><strong>Jack, a student:</strong> I am. They opened applications today.</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie, a student: </strong>I am. And that sentence was grammatically terrible.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack: </strong>Shut up.</p>\n<p><strong>Chris, a student: </strong>I\u2019m not applying.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack</strong> (to Chris)<strong>:</strong> Chicken?</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie:</strong> You\u2019re such a jerk! Maybe he has a job lined up or something, did you ever think of that?</p>\n<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Whoa \u2013</p>\n<p><strong>Chris: </strong>Actually, I\u2019m going backpacking in Australia with my Dad. No internet for about half the time, and when I emailed the people at WordPress they said I should probably wait until next year to apply and make sure I\u2019d be able to be online through the whole summer.</p>\n<p><strong>Professor: </strong>Fair enough. The application period opens today at 19:00 UTC and goes through April 9th, so let\u2019s hear from the people who are applying.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack:</strong> I\u2019m submitting mine today.</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie: </strong>That\u2019s just stupid.</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea, a teacher\u2019s assistant: </strong>Hey, that\u2019s not necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack: </strong>Yeah! The early bird gets the worm, or hadn\u2019t you heard?</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie:</strong> What I heard was that the WordPress mentors are holding open IRC chats this week to talk to prospective students and give them feedback on proposals and ideas, and that talking directly to the mentors ups your chances of being selected. But I guess you don\u2019t think you need the people who are actually choosing the students to know your name because your proposal is so brilliant?</p>\n<p><em>Jack\u2019s jaw drops.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Jack: </strong>Where did you hear that? It wasn\u2019t on the GSoC mailing list.</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie: </strong>I joined the wp-hackers list and asked all the core contributors for feedback on my idea, and then I emailed 3 potential mentors to see what they thought of it personally. By the time applications are due, I\u2019ll have revised it based on community and mentor feedback, and enough people will know who I am \u2014 and that I\u2019m full of initiative \u2014 that my chances of being accepted will be much better.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack: </strong>You think you\u2019re all Felicia Day with your MW2 level 70, but you\u2019re just a computer nerd.</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie:</strong> Um, duh. We\u2019re in an advanced computer programming class. We\u2019re all computer nerds.</p>\n<p><strong>Professor: </strong>Now, now. Sophie\u2019s correct; talking to community members and mentors will improve her chances. But, Jack, there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t join the IRC chats and the mailing list to get your name out there, too, even if you submit your application today. Most proposals get tweaked a bit after the students are chosen anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie: </strong>Plus, Felicia Day is awesome! And <a href=\"http://feliciaday.com/blog\">she uses WordPress</a>, so ha!</p>\n<p><em>End Act II.</em></p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the deal. <a href=\"http://socghop.appspot.com/site/home/site\">The application period opens today</a>. Early applications will likely get a bit more attention up front, but it\u2019s also important that your ideas and approach are vetted by the community and <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2010#Mentors\">the mentors</a>. If you haven\u2019t already, you should join the <a href=\"http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-hackers\">wp-hackers mailing list</a> and send your proposal to the list for feedback. We\u2019ll also be doing a few IRC chats during the application period to give students a chance to talk directly with the mentors. Note that not every mentor will attend all three chats, so if you want to talk to a specific person, you might want to email them. Please arrive on time to the chats, as they will be scheduled for an hour, and will have to accommodate multiple students. IRC chats will be held at irc.freenode.net in room #wordpress-gsoc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wednesday, March March 31 at 20:30 UTC (4:30pm eastern)</li>\n<li>Saturday, April 3 at 21:30 UTC (5:30pm eastern)</li>\n<li>Wednesday, April 7 at 20:30 UTC (4:30pm eastern)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This chat room will remain open during the application period, and various mentors and community members may be there and able to answer questions, but the scheduled chats are the only official times at which they are scheduled to do so.</p>\n<p>Oh, and if you want to help publicize the WordPress summer of code, <a href=\"https://wpdevel.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/wordpress-gsoc-flyer.pdf\">grab a flyer</a> and post it somewhere on a bulletin board at your local college campus.

When all those apps started popping up using the Twitter API, things like automatically following anyone who followed you and sending an automatic Direct Message seemed like good ideas. We\u2019re all friends, right? Wrong. That auto-follow bit us hard, and the huge amount of spam the account gets means that it\u2019s been nearly impossible to monitor legitimate messages from WordPress users and developers who need to be pointed to a help resource. We\u2019re sorry! Just as we needed to get the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/\">Ideas Forum</a> under control* so that it could become a more useful resource for the community, we needed to get rid of the spam clogging our Twitter arteries. Except there was no easy way to do it.</p>\n<p>We had wound up following over 50,000 people. If someone went to the wordpress profile page on Twitter to see the stream of updates from people we followed, almost none of it had anything to do with WordPress or the community. Diet pills, Twitter scams, and multi-posted spam messages were the norm. Yuck! Who else wishes there was <a href=\"http://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a> for Twitter? Unfortunately, there\u2019s no easy way to clear this stuff out quickly (mass unfollows trigger their TOS alert, so it\u2019s not surprising). I even contacted Twitter directly to see what the options might be, and it was suggested we use a script to clear the account.<strong> To be clear: </strong>Twitter flagged our account so that when the script was run they wouldn\u2019t mark us as spammers for violating the TOS with a mass unfollow. We communicated with them beforehand, and the use of scripts to do this is not encouraged. Twitter was doing us a nice favor to help us get our house in order. Thanks, Twitter! Last night I ran the script and removed everyone. Extreme, but in good cause, right?</p>\n<p>We\u2019re now starting to re-follow real people from the WordPress community. There will be no more auto-follow. If you are a WordPress developer, designer, blogger, fan site, whatever \u2014 and think your tweets should appear in the wordpress updates stream, then send an @ reply to us and we can add you to the new list (assuming you\u2019re not hawking diet pills, free iPads or ways to get a million followers). This way, people who are new to WordPress and go to check us out on Twitter will (hopefully) get a sense of the vibrant community that we have. People who send @ messages to us won\u2019t (hopefully) wonder indefinitely why they were ignored, because without all the spam, maybe we can use Twitter as it was intended to be used, as another channel of communication.</p>\n<p>And for anyone who uses Qwitter and thinks wordpress stopped loving them because of the last tweet they posted before the script ran\u2026 sorry! It wasn\u2019t like that, we swear! It would be nice if the script could have done a bulk DM before the removal, but nope (otherwise we\u2019d have included a message about this).

If so, see me after class to discuss getting independent study credit toward your degree.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack, a student:</strong> Isn\u2019t that a really hard program to get into? Like, hard like getting to level 70 in Modern Warfare 2?</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie, a student: </strong>I went past 70, I prestiged.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack</strong> (turning to Sophie)<strong>:</strong> Shut up, you did not!</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie:</strong> I did, too!</p>\n<p><strong>Professor:</strong> Not the point, kids. So who\u2019s going to try for a GSoC spot?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea, a teacher\u2019s assistant: </strong>There are some great open source projects participating this year. I\u2019d love to see someone from this class get in on the WordPress project.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack:</strong> WordPress is awesome, but my friend <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/development/2009/03/wordpress-summer-of-code-2009\">Billy</a> didn\u2019t get chosen by them <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/development/2009/04/summer-of-code-students-announced/\">last year</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie:</strong> Billy\u2019s not as smart as he thinks he is.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack: </strong>You think you could do better?!</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie:</strong> Of course I do! Any primate could do better than Billy! Or you, for that matter!</p>\n<p><strong>Jack: </strong>What? I would so beat you out in a coding competition!</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea: </strong>Sounds like we have the makings of a friendly classroom competition, Prof.</p>\n<p><strong>Professor: </strong>I think you\u2019re right, Andrea. Tell you kids what. They announce the students who\u2019ve been accepted on April 26th, which is before the semester ends. Let\u2019s turn this into a class project.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack </strong>(raising a suspicious eyebrow)<strong>:</strong> How do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Professor: </strong>As a class assignment, everyone has one week to write a project proposal for the Google Summer of Code, specific to the WordPress project. The proposals will be graded like a regular assignment. Anyone who gets an A on the proposal can use me as a reference if they apply with the proposal to WordPress and Google for the program. The application deadline is <strong>April 9</strong>, so you\u2019ll have time to revise your application after it\u2019s been graded.</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie: </strong>What\u2019s in it for us?</p>\n<p><strong>Andrea: </strong>If you\u2019re successful in GSoC you earn $5000 for the summer.</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie </strong>(smirking, to Jack)<strong>: </strong>That\u2019s more than you\u2019ll make working the hot dog cart by City Hall.</p>\n<p><strong>Jack:</strong> You wish. I\u2019m totally getting in, and you\u2019ll be on the hot dog cart this year.</p>\n<p><strong>Professor: </strong>And as I was starting to say in the first place, a GSoC project would qualify for independent study credit. Tell you what, as an added bonus, anyone who actually gets accepted into the WordPress GSoC program will get extra credit points on their year end average.</p>\n<p><strong>Sophie </strong>(perking up)<strong>:</strong> Really? I\u2019m in!</p>\n<p><strong>Jack: </strong>No way, they\u2019ll choose me first!</p>\n<p><em>Stay tuned for the continuing adventures of Jack and Sophie as they navigate the course of applying to Google Summer of Code to work with WordPress.</em></p>\n<p>That\u2019s right, WordPress is honored to be among the 150 open source organizations chosen to participate in Google Summer of Code this year. Students work on WordPress projects over the summer under the guidance of mentors from among the WordPress core developers, and if they complete their projects successfully Google pays them $5000! Talk about a win-win. Last year\u2019s projects led to some very cool code being created, like the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10667\">new search API</a> targeted for version 3.0 and the <a href=\"http://elastictheme.org/\">Elastic theme generator</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Professors: </strong>Help us and your students by telling them about GSoC and encouraging them to apply. Consider having them write a WordPress plugin or core patch as a class assignment so they can get to know the codebase. Offer to sign on as an adviser for a summer independent study so they can get credit for their work with GSoC.</p>\n<p><strong>Students:</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2010\">our Ideas page</a>, and start thinking about projects you\u2019d like to propose. Watch this space for an announcement of some live chat information sessions where you can ask potential mentors questions and get feedback on your pre-proposal ideas. This program is competitive, but is one of the best opportunities out there when it comes to programming. You get real-world experience as a member of an open source community, you make decent money, you make connections with industry leaders, and you get the attention of Google. Not to mention some serious bragging rights. What are you waiting for? Applications will be accepted from March 29-April 9, so start thinking about a project now!</p>\n<p><em><br>\n</em></p>"},

Since that first WordCamp in 2006, back when WordPress was on version 2.0 (Duke), the number of people using WordPress to power their web publishing \u2014 from personal blogs to large-scale commercial sites \u2014 has grown by millions. It\u2019s no wonder this year\u2019s event is going to be so great.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re unfamiliar with <a href=\"http://wordcamp.org/\">WordCamps</a>, here\u2019s the skinny: the San Francisco event is the flagship, put together each year under the direction of WordPress co-founder and lead developer <a href=\"http://ma.tt\">Matt Mullenweg</a>, who traditionally reports on the \u201cState of the Word\u201d and assembles a lineup of <a href=\"http://2010.sf.wordcamp.org/speakers/\">speakers</a> that have inspired him over the past year. This year\u2019s lineup includes luminaries such as Richard Stallman, the father of Free Software, best-selling author Scott Berkun, and Salon.com co-founder Scott Rosenberg. As the final speaker list is finalized, the remaining speakers will be added to the <a href=\"http://2010.sf.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp SF website</a>, but a surprise or two is still possible.</p>\n<p>Though the main event is on Saturday, May 1, there are additional <a href=\"http://2010.sf.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">days of WordPress goodness</a> in store. Saturday, May 1 will be the main conference with scheduled speakers. There will be keynotes, session tracks for both bloggers/end-users and developers, and lightning talks to provide a broad mix of content, followed by a raging afterparty. Sunday, May 2 will shift location and tone, with a low-key developers\u2019 unconference for the super-code-focused attendees. May 3 and 4 are conference-free, but a WordPress core contributor in-person code sprint will span those two days, bringing together core contributors old and new from around the globe for two days of intense hacking (and let\u2019s face it, 3.0 bug fixes).</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re in the Bay Area, or can be, and want to attend <a href=\"http://2010.sf.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp San Francisco</a>, <a href=\"http://2010.sf.wordcamp.org/tickets/\">go get your ticket today</a>!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">*\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 * \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 * \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 * \u00a0 \u00a0 *</p>\n<h3><strong>Other Upcoming WordCamps</strong></h3>\n<p>It\u2019s definitely WordCamp season; just check out the growing list of upcoming WordCamps over the next couple of months!

Whether you\u2019re on vacation or burning the midnight oil, attending a local/nearby <a href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamp</a> is a great way to spend a weekend. Meet other WordPress users, developers, designers &amp; consultants, learn a little something, maybe share a little of your own experience and knowledge, and break bread (or raise a toast) with new friends and collaborators. Here are the WordCamps scheduled for this summer, along with what I know about them.</p>\n<p>July 3: <a href=\"http://wordcamp.de/\">WordCamp Germany</a> \u2013 Berlin, Germany. I love it that they\u2019re using BuddyPress for their event site. They have multiple tracks, and what looks to be a nice variety of sessions. It\u2019s only a few days away, so if you\u2019re thinking of going, get your tickets now!</p>\n<p>July 10: <a href=\"http://2010.boulder.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Boulder</a> \u2013 Boulder, Colorado, USA. This was WordCamp Denver last year, but the organizers have decided to mix it up and go back and forth between Denver and Boulder, which also has a thriving tech community. This year the venue is the Boulder Theater (so pretty!), and there will sessions for bloggers and devs alike, plus a Genius Bar to help people get their WordPress sites all fixed up. The speaker lineup looks good, and I hear they\u2019re pumping up the wifi this year. I\u2019ll be there, likely hunched over a notebook with Lisa Sabin-Wilson (author of <em>WordPress for Dummies</em> and <em>BuddyPress for Dummies</em>) to talk about the WordPress User Handbook project, and/or hunched over a sketchbook with Kevin Conboy (designed the new lighter \u201con\u201d state for admin menus in WordPress 3.0) to work out a new default WordCamp.org theme (using BuddyPress). You can still get tickets!</p>\n<p>July 17\u201318: <a href=\"http://uk.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp UK</a>\u2013 Manchester, England, UK. The roving WordCamp UK will be in Manchester this year, and is probably the closest to BarCamp style of all the WordCamps, using a wiki to plan some speakers/sessions and organizing the rest ad-hoc on the first day of the event. I\u2019ll be attending this one as well, and am looking forward to seeing WordPress lead developer Peter Westwood again. I\u2019m also looking forward to meeting some core contributors for the first time in person, like Simon Wheatley and John O\u2019Nolan. Mike Little, co-founder of WordPress, is on the organizing team of WordCamp UK. Tickets on sale now!</p>\n<p>July 24: WordCamp Nigeria \u2013 Lagos, Nigeria. Their site seems to have a virus, so no link from here, but if you\u2019re in Nigeria and interested in attending/getting involved, a quick Google search will get you to the organizers.</p>\n<p>August 7: <a href=\"http://www.wordcamphouston.com/\">WordCamp Houston</a> \u2013 Houston, TX, USA. Houston, Texas, birthplace of WordPress! Fittingly, Matt Mullenweg will be there to give the keynote. WordCamp Houston is running three tracks \u2014 Business, Blogger and Developer \u2014 in recognition of the fact that people who are interested in using WordPress for their business may not actually be bloggers or developers themselves. This used to get labeled as a \u201cCMS\u201d track at previous WordCamps (including NYC 2009), but with WordPress 3.0 supporting CMS functionality out of the box, \u201cBusiness\u201d is a much more appropriate label.

They haven\u2019t announced this year\u2019s speakers or topics, but they\u2019ve been running polls to get community input into the program. Of note: in 2011 WordCamp New Zealand will be shifting seasons and will be in February instead, when the weather is nicer.</p>\n<p>August 20\u201322: <a href=\"http://2010.savannah.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Savannah</a> \u2013 Savannah, Georgia, USA. Disclaimer: I am completely biased about Savannah, since I\u2019m one of the organizers. This will be the first WordCamp in Savannah, and it\u2019s being held at the Savannah College of Art and Design River Club, an awesome venue that used to be a cotton warehouse or something like that. Since Savannah doesn\u2019t really have a cohesive WordPress community yet (though a fair number of people from Savannah attended WordCamp Atlanta earlier this year), this WordCamp is aimed squarely at building a local community. We\u2019ll have a local meet-and-greet, regular sessions with visiting speakers (lots of core contributors coming to this one, plus Matt), and on Sunday it will be combination unconference/genius bar/collaborative workspace. Oh, and a potluck! We\u2019ll also be running a pre-WordCamp workshop for people who have never used WordPress but want to get started, so that they\u2019ll be able to follow the presentations and conversations littered with WordPress-specific vocabulary over the weekend.

{"title": "Coming Up: Meet the Makers", "content": "<p>I am often asked how decisions are made for WordPress, who\u2019s involved in decision-making, and how the open source project is structured in general. WordPress is a meritocracy, meaning that anyone can get involved, and a combination of the quality of someone\u2019s contributions and their level of interest/time commitment will determine how much influence they have over decisions. Because these factors vary, we have several levels of contributors to the core WordPress application, ranging from full-time lead developers to casual one-patch contributors.</p>\n<p>I loved it when that Intel commercial in 2009 gave Ajay Bhatt, co-inventor of the USB, some recognition as a rock star of geekland (though I hated it that it wasn\u2019t actually Ajay Bhatt, but an actor \u2014 way to kill the message, Intel).<sup>1</sup> In WordPress-land, most people know who Matt Mullenweg is, but most of the other leaders and contributors are much less visible.

That\u2019s part of the community involvement as well \u2014 we expect that those who pitch in will also help shape the process.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s involved in reviewing themes for the directory? There are some obvious things, such as being familiar with PHP and WordPress theme code (and the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development_Checklist\">theme development checklist</a>), with an eye for security issues. You would also need to have the ability to set up a separate install of the latest version of WordPress for testing theme submissions.</p>\n<p>Hopefully a few talented theme developers are reading this right now and saying to themselves, \u201cI\u2019d love to help! How do I get started?\u201d Just join the new <a href=\"http://lists.wordpress.org/mailman/listinfo/theme-reviewers\">theme reviewers mailing list</a> and we\u2019ll get you up to speed on this new opportunity to come to the aid of your community.</p>"},

So we\u2019re taking the next two months to concentrate on improving WordPress.org. A major part of that will be improving the infrastructure of the plugins directory. More than 10,000 plugins are in the directory, every one of them GPL compatible and free as in both beer and speech. Here\u2019s what we have in mind:</p>\n<p>We want to provide developers the tools they need to build the best possible plugins. We\u2019re going to provide better integration with the forums so you can support your users. We\u2019ll make more statistics available to you so you can analyze your user base, and over time we hope to make it easier for you to manage, build, and release localized plugins.</p>\n<p>We want to improve how the core software works with your plugin and the plugin directory. We\u2019re going to focus on ensuring seamless upgrades by making the best possible determinations about compatibility, and offer continual improvements to the plugin installer. And we also want to give you a better developer tool set like SVN notifications and improvements to the bug tracker.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re also going to experiment with other great ideas to help the community help plugin authors. We want it to be easy for you to offer comments to plugin authors and the community, including user reviews and better feedback. We may experiment with an adoption process for abandoned plugins as a way to revitalize hidden gems in the directory. I\u2019m not sure there is a better way to show how extendable WordPress is and how awesome this community is at the same time.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/development/2010/06/thelonious/\">Matt said in the 3.0 release announcement</a>, our goal isn\u2019t to make everything perfect all at once. But we think incremental improvements can provide us with a great base for 3.1 and beyond, and for the tens of millions of users, and hundreds of millions of plugin downloads to come.</p>"},

WordCamps are locally-organized casual conferences of, by, and for WordPress users, developers, and enthusiasts just like you. The focus of a WordCamp is to foster face-to-face connections and collaboration among the local WordPress crowd, but there are usually some out-of-towners there as well. Here are the WordCamps that have been approved so far for the summer:</p>\n<p>April 16:\u00a0<a href=\"http://wordcampseattle.org/\">WordCamp Seattle</a>\u00a0in Seattle, WA. This weekend! After taking a year off, WordCamp Seattle is back with tracks for bloggers, designers, and developers. This year they\u2019ll feature a lineup including presentations by both local speakers and visitors like core committer Andrew Nacin, as well as an Ignite session of lightning talks at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>May 5:\u00a0<a href=\"http://wordcampdevelopers.com/\">WordCamp Vancouver (Developer Edition)</a>\u00a0in Vancouver, BC. This one-day WordCamp is aimed purely at developers working on the WordPress platform, and will not have content aimed at bloggers (as previous Vancouver WordCamps have). I predict we will start seeing more of these types of niche WordCamps moving forward, because they will mean smaller, more intimate events that allow more collaboration (and make it easier to find venues!). Note that we\u2019re working with the organizers to get the tickets to a more reasonable price, so keep your eyes open this week if you\u2019ve held off on buying a ticket because of the price tag.</p>\n<p>May 7:\u00a0<a href=\"http://wordcamp-switzerland.ch/\">WordCamp Switzerland</a>\u00a0in Brugg, Switzerland.\u00a0This one will cover a wide range of topics, including getting started with WordPress, advanced development topics, BuddyPress, and an inside look at running a WordPress-based business.</p>\n<p>May 14:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ocwordcamp.com/\">WordCamp Orange County</a>\u00a0in Orange, CA. Already sold out! Orange County had their first WordCamp last year, and the organizers have put together another great event this time around.</p>\n<p>May 14:\u00a0<a href=\"http://paris14mai2011.wordcamp.fr/\">WordCamp Paris</a>\u00a0in Paris, France. One of the last true unconference-style WordCamps, the Paris group will plan their schedule the morning of the event like they do at BarCamps. WordCamp Paris had one of the best WordCamp t-shirts ever a couple of years ago. And it\u2019s in Paris in the spring.</p>\n<p>May\u00a021\u201322:\u00a0<a href=\"http://wordcampraleigh.com/\">WordCamp Raleigh</a>\u00a0in Raleigh, NC. Repeat organizers from the Raleigh WordPress Meetup Group are just starting to select speakers and put together their plans, but if it is anything like last year, the venue will be packed with WordPress professionals (and maybe there will be cookies). I\u2019ll be attending this one, as will Nacin.</p>\n<p>June\u00a04\u20135:\u00a0<a href=\"http://2011.reno.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Reno-Lake Tahoe</a>\u00a0in Reno, NV.

WordCamp Columbus has a new organizer this year and is bringing the focus more firmly onto WordPress (and less on social media). Their 3-day event includes an entire day for newbies, and another for non-profits, a nice addition to the usual blogger/developer tracks.</p>\n<p>July\u00a09\u201310:\u00a0<a href=\"http://wcmtl.org/\">WordCamp Montreal</a>\u00a0in Montreal, Quebec. This group consistently puts on a great every year. If you register now, you can still get a $10 discount and get both days for only $30 (with sessions in both English and French to reflect the bilingual nature of the city). Montreal plays host to a number of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.montreal.com/tourism/festivals/index.html\">festivals</a>\u00a0throughout the year, and this weekend is no different, including festivals for the arts, comedy, tango, and even circus arts.</p>\n<p>July 16:\u00a0<a href=\"http://2011.sandiego.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp San Diego</a>\u00a0in San Diego, CA. First WordCamp in San Diego! They have talking about this for over a year, and are now starting to really ramp up the planning. They\u2019re finalizing their venue right now, and I would expect a great roster of speakers.</p>\n<p>July 16-17: <a href=\"http://wiki.wordcampuk.org/Main_Page\">WordCamp Portsmouth</a> in Portsmouth, UK. The annual WordCamp UK that moves from city to city each year alights this year in Portsmouth.

{"title": "Software Freedom Day + Hackathon", "content": "<p>Saturday, September 17 is <a href=\"http://softwarefreedomday.org/\">Software Freedom Day</a>. To that end, a few announcements about this weekend\u2019s hackathon and <a href=\"2011.portland.wordcamp.org\">WordCamp Portland</a>.</p>\n<h3>3.3 Hackathon</h3>\n<p>WordPress 3.3 is about to hit feature freeze. This means it\u2019s the last chance to squeeze in features that haven\u2019t quite been finished, and enhancements and fixes that no one has had time to address yet. Around this time, there are often dozens of tickets that have patches, but the patches have not been tested enough to be committed to core. Then the contributors who worked hard on the patches are disappointed that their code doesn\u2019t make it into the current release. You can help us prevent this!</p>\n<p>This weekend, we\u2019ll be running a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/13\">has-patch needs-testing marathon</a> for the 3.3 milestone. Basically, we\u2019re looking for people who can help test patches and/or refresh patches that need updating. Lead developers and core contributors will be hanging around in the #wordpress-dev channel on irc.freenode.net to answer questions as needed, and will be committing patches as they get enough verification. As you test the patches, report your findings on the trac tickets in question. If all developers who make a living working with WordPress helped out for even an hour or two this weekend, we could clear the 200 tickets or so that are in this situation. To make it fun, why not get together with other WordPress devs and have an in-person hackathon meetup?</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Portland</h3>\n<p>At WordCamp Portland this weekend, some of the WordPress core team will be in attendance, including me, Nacin, and Koop. In addition to giving presentations and participating in the unconference sessions, we\u2019ll be involved with a couple of other cool things at WCPDX:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hacker Room.</strong> There will be room set aside for people to work on core bugs and features slated for the 3.3 release. Hopefully PDX developers will hang out in here some of the time helping with the marathon.</li>\n<li><strong>Welcome Free Software Projects!</strong> Normally WordCamps are 100% focused on WordPress, but in light of Software Freedom Day, the WC PDX organizers, in conjunction with the WordPress Foundation, would like to extend an invitation to all free software projects to participate in WordCamp Portland. There are a couple of rooms set aside that can be used for unconference sessions and/or hacker rooms for other projects. It would be great to have local representatives from a bunch of projects there \u2014 almost a micro version of OS Bridge or OSCON \u2014 to maximize the free software love and cross-pollinate ideas. Developers from other projects are also welcome in the WP hackathon room if they\u2019d like to pitch in. Saturday will also feature the Software Freedom Day Happy Hour at the end of sessions. For more information or to get your project involved, contact the event organizers via the <a href=\"http://2011.portland.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Portland website</a>\u00a0or email support at wordcamp dot org.</li>\n<li><strong>Usability Testing of 3.3 Alpha.</strong> As mentioned, we\u2019re about to hit freeze, so we\u2019ll be giving WordCamp Portland attendees a sneak peek at 3.3, seeing how they adjust to the new features, and getting feedback to help us with our last round of fixes before we get to Beta. There will be a signup sheet to participate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, if you live it the Portland/Seattle area and haven\u2019t already bought a ticket to attend WordCamp Portland, hurry up, as it\u2019s going to be a great celebration of Software Freedom Day and WordPress.</p>"},
{"title": "Taking WordPress to War", "content": "<p>Today is the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the (20)eleventh year, and\u00a0in several parts of the world, it is a holiday related to war. In the U.S., where I live, it is\u00a0Veterans Day, which honors military veterans. In much of Europe, today is Armistice Day or Remembrance Day, commemorating the armistice signed at the \u201celeventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\u201d of 1918 that ended the fighting on the Western Front in World War I.</p>\n<p>Whether serving in the military, living in an area of unrest or attack, having friends or family in the fray, or just being human enough to think war sucks (there\u2019s really no gentler way to say that, is there?), war impacts most people in the world today.</p>\n<p>The mission of WordPress is to democratize publishing. Sometimes we\u2019re fortunate enough for that to mean providing a platform for communication that helps people work toward peace in their communities and around the world. Sometimes it means providing a platform for keeping people informed and aware of the other things that are happening around the world, including the horror of wars and revolutions.</p>\n<p>At WordCamp San Francisco in August, one of the most popular and well-respected sessions was led by Teru Kuwayama of <a href=\"http://basetrack.org/\">Basetrack.org</a>. On this day of remembrance, I thought it would be good to share the video of his presentation.

Basically, it\u2019s people in a community getting together \u2014 meeting up \u2014 who share an interest in WordPress, whether they be bloggers, business users, developers, consultants, or any other category of person able to say, \u201cI use WordPress in some way and I like it, and I want to meet other people who can say the same.\u201d Meetups come in different shapes and sizes, but they all carry the benefit of connecting you with potential collaborators and friends, and helping you learn more about what you can do with WordPress. Here are some of the common types of WordPress meetups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hang out and work on your WordPress sites together</li>\n<li>Social/happy hour type gatherings</li>\n<li>Mini-lectures/presentations</li>\n<li>Developer hacking meetups</li>\n<li>Show &amp; tell of how group members are using WordPress</li>\n<li>Formal instruction on how to use WordPress</li>\n<li>Lecture series (possibly with visiting speakers)</li>\n<li>Genius bar/help desk</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There\u2019s no prescribed format, as each local group can decide for itself what they want to do. Some groups mix it up from month to month, while others have multiple events each month to satisfy the needs of their community.</p>\n<p>The tough part? Running a popular group takes time and money. Just as we worked last year to remove the financial burden for <a href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamp</a> organizers and provide logistical support so they could focus more on their event content and experience, we want to start extending that kind of support to meetup groups as well. We don\u2019t want it to cost anything for someone to run a WordPress meetup, or to attend one \u2014 building local communities should be as free as WordPress itself!</p>\n<p>Since there are so many more meetups than there are WordCamps, we\u2019re going to start with the cost that is the same for every group: meetup.com organizer dues. We\u2019re setting up an official WordPress account on <a href=\"http://Meetup.com\">Meetup.com</a> right now, and over the next couple of weeks will be working with existing meetup group organizers, people who want to start a new meetup group, and the helpful folks at Meetup.com to put this program in place. WordPress meetup groups that choose to have their group become part of the WordPress account will no longer pay organizer dues for that group, as the <a href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org\">WordPress Foundation</a> will be footing the bill.</p>\n<p>This is exciting for several reasons. First, it means local organizers who are giving something back to the project by way of their time won\u2019t also have shell out $12-19/month for the privilege. That alone is a big step. Second, it will open the door to more events and leaders within a community, since leadership and event planning won\u2019t need to be tied to \u201cowning\u201d the meetup group. Third, more active meetup groups means more WordCamps, yay!</p>\n<p>In addition to the financial aspects, we\u2019ll be working on ways to improve social recognition of meetup activity by incorporating feeds from the official meetup groups into the WordPress.org site, and including meetup group participation in the activity stream on your <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org profile</a>.<sup>2</sup> I\u2019m also hoping we can do something around providing video equipment to meetup groups (like we already do for WordCamps) to record presentations and tutorials that can be posted to <a href=\"http://WordPress.tv\">WordPress.tv</a>, helping meetup groups offer WordPress classes in their community, and getting involved with mentoring WordPress clubs at local schools and universities. Oh, and we\u2019ll send out some WordPress buttons and stickers to the groups that join in, because everyone loves buttons and stickers.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re also putting together some cool resources for people who want to start a new meetup group. There will be a field guide to getting started and some supplies to help you get your group going, and a forum for organizers to talk to and learn from each other.</p>\n<p>Over time, we\u2019ll be talking to organizers and looking at what other expenses we can absorb and what other support we can provide to local groups. For now, we\u2019re starting with the organizer dues. If you currently run a WordPress meetup group (whether you are using Meetup.com or not) or would like to start a WordPress meetup group in your area, please fill out our <a href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-meetup-groups\">WordPress Meetup Groups survey</a>. Filling in the survey doesn\u2019t obligate you to join the official group, it just gives us a starting point to a) find out what groups are around/interested, and b) get some information on existing groups and their expenses and needs. Meetup.com will contact the group organizers who\u2019ve said they\u2019d like to join the new program, and will walk them through the logistics of the change and answer questions before helping them to opt-in officially.</p>\n<p>So, if you currently run a WordPress meetup group, or you would like to start one, please \u00a0fill out our\u00a0<a href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-meetup-groups\">WordPress Meetup Groups survey</a>.

Our booth was packed to overflowing last year as we helped people with their blogs and gave away WordPress swag, so this year we\u2019ll have more space to meet as many of you as possible.

The party this year will be at the <a href=\"http://www.purevolume.com/thehouse/\">Buzzmedia Pure Volume House</a>, and the story of how we hooked up with them is pretty cool.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Once upon a time, David Wang had a business called Buzzmedia in Malaysia, with the twitter username @buzzmedia. When David changed gears and started <a href=\"http://clickwp.com/\">ClickWP</a>, a WordPress support business, he stopped going by the Buzzmedia name. In the U.S., a company also called Buzzmedia wished it had that Twitter username, and asked if they could have it since David wasn\u2019t going to use it anymore.</p>\n<p>David, feeling the WordPress community love, said he would give them the name, and suggested they do something in return for the WordPress Foundation. So, everyone talked to everyone else and it worked out that Buzzmedia was willing to donate a fantastic venue for this year\u2019s party as well as covering the bar.</p>\n<p>In the end, the Foundation got a great SXSW party, Buzzmedia got their twitter username, and David got the warm glow of having used his power for the good of the WordPress community, and they all lived happily ever after.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Seriously, though, the PureVolume House is always a great SXSW venue, so thank you David and Buzzmedia for your generosity! We\u2019ll have drinks and snacks and a few hundred WordPress-loving partygoers, so you know it will be a good time. Kind of like a WordCamp afterparty without all the work of a WordCamp. \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>The venue can hold 500 people, and based on last year, we\u2019ll hit that pretty quickly. The one requirement is that you use WordPress. On the RSVP form, you will be asked to enter the URL of your WordPress-powered site (if you have more than one, just pick your main site). If you fill in this field with something other than what\u2019s requested (such as \u201cN/A\u201d or putting in a fake url) your RSVP may be deleted, so please make sure to enter your real site.<br>\n<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/sxsw2012/\"> RSVP Now</a>!</p>"},

The recent <a href=\"http://godaddyboycott.org/\">SOPA-related boycott of GoDaddy</a> was all over the news, with many people expressing their outrage over the possibilities of SOPA, but when I ask people about SOPA and its sister bill in the Senate, PIPA (Protect IP Act), many don\u2019t really know what the bills propose, or what we stand to lose. If you are not freaked out by SOPA/PIPA, please: for the next four minutes, instead of checking Facebook statuses, seeing who mentioned you on Twitter, or watching the latest episode of Sherlock*, watch this video (by <a href=\"http://fightforthefuture.org/\">Fight for the Future</a>).</p>\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/31100268\" width=\"632\" height=\"356\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<p>Some thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the U.S. our legal system maintains that the burden of proof is on the accuser, and that people are innocent until proven guilty.

We should not be so quick to codify something this far-reaching.</li>\n<li>The people writing these laws are not the people writing the independent web, and they are not out to protect it. We have to stand up for it ourselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Blogging is a form of activism. You can be an agent of change. Some people will tell you that taking action is useless, that online petitions, phone calls to representatives, and other actions won\u2019t change a single mind, especially one that\u2019s been convinced of something by lobbyist dollars.

{"title": "Calling All Contributors: Community Summit 2012", "content": "<p>Each year, the WordPress core development team meets in person for a week to work together and discuss the vision for WordPress in the coming year. As annual events go, it\u2019s easily my favorite. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love attending <a title=\"WordCamp Central\" href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamps</a> and local <a title=\"WordPress on Meetup.com\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/\">WordPress meetups</a> (which are awesome and you should try to attend if you are able), but at the core team meetup, the focus on working together and getting things done is unique, as is the experience of every person in the room being so highly qualified. This year, instead of just planning a core team meetup, I\u2019m aiming a little higher and shooting for a full-on contributor/community summit.</p>\n<p>Core code isn\u2019t the only way to contribute to the WordPress project. We have an active <a title=\"Theme Review Team blog\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">theme review team</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">support forum</a> volunteers, people writing <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page\">documentation</a>, plugin managers, community event organizers, translators, and more. The teams have been siloed for too long, so we\u2019ve recently begun the process of bringing them together by having teams elect representatives to facilitate more communication between the contributor groups. These reps will form the nucleus of the contributor summit now being planned for a long weekend at the end of October in Tybee Island, GA. This is completely different from a WordCamp. It will be a combination of co-working, unconference, and discussions among the project leaders, and participation will be by invitation.</p>\n<p>In addition to bringing together the active contributor team reps to work together, I think it\u2019s important to include community members who don\u2019t fall into that category (at least not yet!). Successful WordPress-based business, authors of popular plugins and themes, and people using WordPress in unexpected but intriguing ways should have a place at the table, too. That said, part of the magic of the core team meetup is the small size; it allows every voice not only to be heard, but to engage. Since this is my first attempt at bringing together so many groups and points of view, I want to try and keep it small enough to retain that personal atmosphere while at the same time ensuring that the best possible mix of people and businesses in the WordPress ecosystem is represented. This is where you come in!</p>\n<p>Taking a cue from events with limited availability like <a title=\"AdaCamp\" href=\"http://dc.adacamp.org/\">AdaCamp</a>\u00a0(attendance) and the <a title=\"jQuery Conference\" href=\"http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/\">jQuery conference</a>\u00a0(speaker roster), I want you to <a title=\"Nomination survey\" href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations\">nominate people and/or WordPress-based businesses to participate in the summit</a>. Yes, you can nominate yourself.* You can nominate up to 10 additional people \u2014 be prepared to provide URLs and the reason you think they should participate. You can also nominate up to 10 WordPress-based businesses without naming individual people, so if there\u2019s a theme or hosting company (for example) that you think should be there, you don\u2019t need to go looking for employee names. This nomination process will hopefully ensure that we don\u2019t overlook someone who is making a difference in our community when it comes time to issue invitations.</p>\n<p>Nominations will be open for a week, after which <a href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations\">the survey</a> will be closed and the process of analyzing the results** will begin. The nominations process will lead to invitations in June, confirmations in July, planning in August and September, and the summit itself in October. Hopefully we can stream and/or record some of the activity to share online at\u00a0<a href=\"http://wordpress.tv\">WordPress.tv</a>. Additional invitations may be extended up until the event if there are people/businesses that become more active in the community. If you\u2019re thinking to yourself that maybe now\u2019s the perfect time to start <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress\">contributing time to the WordPress project</a>, good thinking! In the meantime, if you want to weigh in, <a href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations\">fill in the community summit nomination form</a>. Thanks, and wish us luck!</p>\n<p><em>* Nominating yourself: Do nominate yourself if you fall into one of the categories described in the post above, or if you believe that you have a unique point of view. Please do not nominate yourself if you just think it would be cool to hang out with this group.

{"title": "Event Organizers Unite!", "content": "<p>I\u2019m happy to announce the formation of a new official contributor group within the WordPress project for the organizers of in-person events that promote WordPress. Though there are hundreds of people around the globe organizing WordCamps, WordPress meetups, hackathons, free classes and the like, since their \u201cprojects\u201d were all happening locally there was never a central hub of activity for these folks. Despite the many informal connections between community organizers, we weren\u2019t taking advantage of the huge existing knowledge base as new organizers stepped up to the plate.</p>\n<p>With the creation of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/events/\">this new contributor group</a>, we finally have a way to organize and recognize these kinds of contributions, a clear avenue for feedback and input when it comes to policies around official events, and the opportunity to create even more connections between community organizers through mentorship programs and group projects. I\u2019m especially excited about the creation of this group because until now the role of community organizer, while one of the most important, has not gotten the same recognition as higher-profile contribution methods such as forum support or core code contribution. That is something I hope this group will change, and the local organizers can be recognized for the community leaders they are.*</p>\n<p>If you are the organizer of a local WordCamp, WordPress meetup, etc., head over to\u00a0<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/events/\">https://make.wordpress.org/events/</a> and introduce yourself so we can include you in the fun!</p>\n<p>Speaking of meetups, an update on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/year-of-the-meetup/\">my last post about meetups</a> is long overdue. With around 500 meetup organizers (and/or potential organizers) responding to my last survey, it took much longer than anticipated to review all the responses. We\u2019re working now with meetup.com to issue invitations to join a centralized WordPress Meetup account, so if you filled out the form earlier this year, you should be hearing from them soon. The first wave of existing meetup account transfers (for those who opted in) should happen in the next two weeks, with additional waves every 3 months thereafter (and new groups will be able to be created along the way).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2012/05/calling-all-contributors-community-summit-2012/\">contributor summit</a> that is being planned for the end of October also generated hundreds of responses/nominations, so that review process is still happening, but we should be announcing some basic plans and issuing invitations soon.</p>\n<p>And finally, it would be impossible to talk about in-person WordPress events without mentioning the upcoming annual <a href=\"http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org\">WordCamp in San Francisco</a>. As the event that represents the worldwide project as a whole, it\u2019s the perfect time to evaluate where we stand as a project and as a community, to help determine where we go next. If you\u2019re a WordPress user, developer, or in any way a part of our vast and interconnected ecosystem, please take a moment to fill in\u00a0the <a href=\"http://wpsurvey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2012\">2nd annual WordPress survey</a>. It\u2019s just a couple of questions, and your input would be greatly appreciated. The results of the survey will be announced at <a href=\"http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org\">WSCF</a>, and a report issued shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>*<em> I am also of the firm belief that academic and arts activities should earn varsity letters just like sports teams do \u2014 go mathletes!\u00a0</em></p>"},
{"title": "2012: A Look Back", "content": "<p>Another year is coming to a close, and it\u2019s time to look back and reflect on what we\u2019ve accomplished in the past twelve months. The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/\">3.4</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/\">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited \u201cmedia release\u201d featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool.\u00a03.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead.\u00a0We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms \u2014 <a href=\"https://ios.wordpress.org/\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://android.wordpress.org/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://blackberry.wordpress.org/\">Blackberry</a>, <a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/\">Windows Phone</a>, <a href=\"https://nokia.wordpress.org/\">Nokia</a>, and <a href=\"https://webos.wordpress.org/\">WebOS</a> \u2014 and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic \u00a0updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The \u201cMake\u201d Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">core</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">theme review</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/\">forum support</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/\">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we\u2019ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/\">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what\u2019s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit\">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A \u201cconference of conversations,\u201d this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We\u2019ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won\u2019t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href=\"http://sopastrike.com/numbers/\">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn\u2019t be a recap without counting up the <a href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans. If you didn\u2019t make it to a WordCamp this year, maybe it can be one of your new year resolutions: <a href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">check the schedule</a> to find one near you!</p>"},
{"title": "Summer Mentorship Programs: GSoC and Gnome", "content": "<p>As an open source, free software project, WordPress depends on the contributions of hundreds of people from around the globe \u2014 contributions in areas like core code, documentation, answering questions in the support forums, translation, and all the other things it takes to make WordPress the best publishing platform it can be, with the most supportive community. This year, we\u2019re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013\">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors\">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013\">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn\u2019t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors\u2019 time. Gnome doesn\u2019t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program\u2019s </span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\" href=\"https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies\">sponsorship information</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general. (Pick us, pick us! \ud83d\ude42 )</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The summer installment of the Gnome Outreach Program for Women follows the same schedule and general application format as GSoC, though there are more potential projects since it covers more areas of contribution. Women college students interested in doing a coding project are encouraged to apply for both programs to increase the odds of acceptance. All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women\">Gnome Outreach Program for Women page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p>The application period just started, and it lasts another week (May 1 for Gnome, May 3 for GSoC), so if you think you qualify and are interested in getting involved, check out the information pages, get in touch, and apply\u2026 Good luck!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013\">Google Summer of Code 2013 Information</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women\">Gnome Summer Outreach Program for Women 2013 Information</a></p>"},

Over the two day span, forum moderators will be available online to help new contributors and answer questions as needed.

{"title": "Experiment: WordCamp Incubator", "content": "<p><a href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamps</a> are locally-organized WordPress conferences that happen all over the world (and are so fun). Sometimes people don\u2019t realize that WordCamps are organized by local volunteers rather than a central organization, and they contact us asking, \u201cCan\u00a0you bring WordCamp to my city?\u201d When this happens, we always\u00a0suggest they start with a meetup\u00a0group, and think about organizing a WordCamp themselves after their group has been active for a few months. We emphasize that WordCamps are\u00a0locally-organized events, not something that the central <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community\">community team</a> plans from afar.</p>\n<p>This has been successful in many areas \u2014 there are currently 241 meetup groups on our meetup.com chapter program! In some regions, though, enthusiastic volunteers have had more of a challenge getting things started. Because\u00a0of this, we\u2019re going to try an experiment this year called the WordCamp Incubator.</p>\n<p>The intention of the incubator program is to help spread WordPress to underserved areas through providing\u00a0more significant organizing support for a first event. In practical terms, this experiment means we\u2019ll be choosing\u00a0three cities in 2016 where there is not an active WordPress community \u2014 but where it seems like there is a lot of potential and where there are some people excited to become organizers \u2014 and will help to organize their first WordCamp. These WordCamps will be\u00a0small, one-day, one-track events geared toward the goal of generating interest and getting people involved in creating an ongoing local community.*</p>\n<p>So, where should we do these three events? \u00a0If you have always wanted a WordCamp in your city but haven\u2019t been able to get a meetup group going, this is\u00a0a great opportunity. We will be taking applications for the next week, then will get in touch with everyone who applied to discuss the possibilities. We will announce the \u00a0cities chosen by the end of March.</p>\n<p>To apply, <a href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordcamp-incubator-application\">fill in the application</a> by February 26, 2016. You don\u2019t need to have any specific information handy, it\u2019s just a form to let us know you\u2019re interested. You can apply to nominate your city even if you don\u2019t want to be the main organizer, but for this experiment \u00a0we will need local liaisons and volunteers, so please only nominate cities where you live or work so that we have at least one local connection to begin.</p>\n<p>Thanks, and good luck!</p>\n<p><em><strong>*\u00a0</strong>For the record, that describes the ideal first WordCamp even if you have an active meetup \u2014 there\u2019s no need to wait until your group is big enough to support a large multi-day event, and small events are a lot of fun because everyone has a chance to be involved and get to know most of the other attendees.</em></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"},
{"title": "Contributor Weekend: One-Hour Video", "content": "<p>It\u2019s time for our second global contributor weekend, and this time we\u2019re focusing on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/tv\">video\u00a0team</a>.\u00a0For this month\u2019s challenge, in honor of it being our second month, you have two options for how you can participate! The challenge for this month overall is to work with at least one hour worth of WordCamp video, which you can do by either creating subtitles or editing the video file in preparation for upload to <a href=\"http://WordPress.tv\">WordPress.tv</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the great things about contributing to the video team is that you get to learn so much, since all the work basically involves watching WordCamp presentation videos. Subtitling is a doubly important need, as it is needed to make all those WordCamp videos accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing and can\u2019t listen to the audio track, as well as making it possible for the videos to be consumed (in some cases after subtitle translation) by people\u00a0who speak different languages.</p>\n<p>The challenge will last from Saturday, February 27, 2016 through Sunday, February 28, 2016, and the results will be reviewed afterward by members of the video team. If you enjoy the challenge, the video team would be very excited to welcome you into their ranks!\u00a0Interested? <a href=\"https://wp.me/P6onIa-28D\">Here\u2019s how to participate</a>.</p>\n<h3>What About Last Month?</h3>\n<p>In January, the inaugural contributor weekend was focused on the support forums. That challenge had 73 participants, including 10 people who provided\u00a020 or more correct answers to open support threads, thereby winning the challenge. Congratulations to\u00a0Harris Anastasiadis, Ahmad Awais, Takis Bouyouris,\u00a0Phil Erb, Eric Gunawan,\u00a0Jackie McBride,\u00a0Diana Nichols, Kostas Nicolacopoulos, Juhi Saxena, and Sarah Semark! To them and to everyone else who participated, thank you <strong>so much</strong> for your efforts. Every answer helps, and over the course of this contributor weekend, these amazing volunteers responded to <strong>800 support threads</strong>. The support forums queue of requests with no replies went from 28 pages to 7 pages \u2014 that was an incredible success, of which every participant was a part!</p>\n<p>So head on over to see how to <a href=\"https://wp.me/P6onIa-28D\">get involved with the one-hour video challenge</a> this weekend, and help us make next month\u2019s post just as impressive! \ud83d\ude42</p>"},
{"title": "Equity and the Power of Community", "content": "<p>Over the past week, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. I have been thinking about white supremacy, the injustice that Black women and men are standing up against across the world, and all the injustices I can\u2019t know, and don\u2019t see.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress mission is to democratize publishing, and to me, that has always meant more than the freedom to express yourself. Democratizing publishing means giving voices to the voiceless and amplifying those speaking out against injustice. It means learning things that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t. To me, it means that every voice has the ability to be heard, regardless of race, wealth, power, and opportunity. WordPress is a portal to commerce; it is a canvas for identity, and a catalyst for change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While WordPress as an open source project may not be capable of refactoring unjust judicial systems or overwriting structural inequality, this does not mean that we, the WordPress community, are powerless. WordPress can\u2019t dismantle white supremacy, but the WordPress community can invest in underrepresented groups (whose experiences cannot be substituted for) and hire them equitably. WordPress can\u2019t eradicate prejudice, but the WordPress community can hold space for marginalized voices in our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot of racial, societal, and systemic injustice to fight. At times, change may seem impossible, and certainly, it\u2019s been too slow. But I know in my heart that the WordPress community is capable of changing the world.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to learn more about how to make a difference in your own community, here are a few resources I\u2019ve gathered from WordPressers just like you.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://href.li/?http://www.socialjusticetoolbox.com/\">Social Justice Toolbox</a></li><li><a href=\"http://antiracismforbeginners.com/\">Anti-racism resource list</a></li><li>An open source <a href=\"https://guidetoallyship.com/\">Guide to Allyship</a></li><li><a href=\"https://allienimmons.com/how-to-be-a-wordpress-ally/\">How to be a WordPress Ally</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/black-lives-matter-europe/\">Supporting Black Lives Matter in Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"https://feminisminindia.com/2019/06/03/colourism-fairness-india/\">Cost of Colourism in India</a>\u00a0</li><li><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/verna_myers_how_to_overcome_our_biases_walk_boldly_toward_them?language=en\">Overcoming Biases by Walking Toward Them</a>\u00a0</li></ul>"},

She had just finished high school and was awaiting her results for admission to university. She spent all of her time (10 hours a day) and all of her pocket money buying bulk time online at cafes. All the way through university that was true, until in 2008 she graduated with a degree in philosophy and bought her own computer and modem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She started blogging in 2009. Initially, she tried out Blogger, Hubpages, and WordPress\u2014but found WordPress too complicated.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Growing up as a timid but curious cat</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mary is one of four kids, and the only girl among her siblings. Throughout her childhood she felt shy, even though others didn\u2019t always see her that way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she first started her personal blog, it was mostly an opportunity for her to speak her mind where she was comfortable. Blogging gave her a medium to express her thoughts and with every new post she became a better writer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rediscovering WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing a postgraduate diploma in mass communication, Mary started a Masters degree in Information Management. This required a three month internship. She decided to volunteer in Ghana in 2015 at the headquarters of the Salesians of Don Bosco in West Africa (SDBAFW<strong>)</strong> where her uncle was based.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While she was there, her uncle asked Mary why she was not blogging on WordPress, which also happened to be the software the organisation used. She explained how difficult and complicated it was so he shared a group of beginner-level tutorial videos with her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After two weeks of watching those videos, she started to realize she could have a full-time career doing this. So she immediately joined a number of online training groups so she could learn everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>I saw a lot of people earning an income from things I knew and did for the fun of it. I found myself asking why I had not turned my passion into a business.</em></p><cite>Mary Job</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long after that, she was contacted by a website editor who was impressed by her blog. With the information available online for WordPress, she was able to learn everything she needed to improve and redesign a site for what turned into her first client.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"512\" height=\"288\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/my-home-office-in-2016.jpeg?resize=512%2C288&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8412\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/my-home-office-in-2016.jpeg?w=512&amp;ssl=1 512w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/my-home-office-in-2016.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"><figcaption>Mary\u2019s home office in 2016</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>I visited the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/showcase/\">WordPress.org showcase</a> and was wowed with all the good things I could do with WordPress.</em></p><cite>Mary Job</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016 after a year of deep WordPress learning, she had fallen in love with the CMS and wanted to give back to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">WordPress open source project</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She volunteered to help the Community team. And when she moved to Lagos later that year, she discovered there was an active WordPress Meetup community. This started her journey toward becoming a WordPress Meetup Co-organizer and a Global Community Team Deputy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today the Nigerian WordPress community continues to grow, as has the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Lagos-WordPress-Meetup-Group\">Lagos WordPress Meetup</a> group. The first Nigerian WordCamp took place in Lagos in 2018 and a <a href=\"https://2020.lagos.wordcamp.org/\">2020 event is being planned</a>. A local WordPress community also developed in Mary\u2019s hometown in Ijebu.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>I have made great friends and met co-organizers in the community who are dedicated to building and sharing their WordPress knowledge with the community like I am.</em></p><cite>Mary Job</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>What did Mary gain from using and contributing to WordPress?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>She <strong>overcame her stage fright</strong> by getting up in front of an audience at her local Meetup to introduce speakers and to talk about the WordPress community.\u00a0</li><li>She <strong>attended her first of many African WordCamps </strong>in Cape Town, South Africa.

He started with digging into MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 first and learned tons by trial and error. Following that adventure, Mario built his first HTML site in 1999. He found development so exciting that he spent day and night learning QBasic and started working at the local PC game club. Mario got involved with several other things related to website administration (translating security bulletins, setting up simple sites, etc) and soon found the technology field was full of activities he really enjoyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Corporate Lifestyle</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario started studying programming including an intensive high-level course for C#, Java development, and software engineering, and eventually got a job in a corporate environment. He soon became a team lead there, managing all the planning and paperwork for their projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But he continued freelancing on the side. He grew his own network of technical experts through attending, volunteering at, and organizing conferences. He also ran a technical forum and regularly spoke at universities and enterprise companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Remote Working and Business Opportunity</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination of a high workload and a daily three-hour-long commute made Mario\u2019s life difficult. Many of his friends were still studying, traveling or unemployed. The blissful and calm lives they lived seemed like a fairy tale to him. And even while both his managers and his clients were abroad, he was unable to obtain permission to work remotely.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Mario decided to leave his job and start freelancing full time. But he found he faced a massive challenge.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He discovered Java projects were pretty large and required an established team of people working together in an office. All job opportunities were on-site, and some even required relocation abroad. Certified Java programmers weren\u2019t being hired on a remote basis.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Mario had some PHP experience from previous jobs, he used this to start his freelance career. For his projects, he used both plain PHP and PHP frameworks like CakePHP and CodeIgniter.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a while, Mario accepted work using commonly known platforms including Joomla, Drupal, and WordPress. In addition, he worked on PHP, Java, Python and some C# projects for a couple of years, after which he decided to switch to WordPress completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Building products</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of his projects involved a technically challenging charity backed by several international organizations. Unexpected shortages in the team put him in the technical lead position. As a result, Mario found himself planning the next phases, meeting with the client regularly, and renegotiating the terms. The team completed the project successfully, and after the launch, a TV campaign led millions of visitors to the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of the successful launch, this client invited Mario to participate in more WordPress projects, including building a custom framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cI wasn\u2019t that acquainted with WordPress back then. For me, a conventional person trained in architectural design patterns and best practices, WordPress seemed like an eccentric young hipster somewhere on the line between insane and genius at the same time. I had to spend a couple of months learning WordPress from the inside out.\u201d</em></p><cite>Mario Peshev</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As his interest in WordPress grew, Mario stopped delivering other custom platforms, and converted clients to WordPress.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>European Community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?fit=632%2C356&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Mario presenting to an audience\" class=\"wp-image-8546\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/04/20191001_144227-scaled.jpg?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\"><figcaption>Mario presenting at a WordCamp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For Mario, one of the key selling points of WordPress was the international openness. He had previously been involved with other open source communities, some of which were US-focused. He felt they were more reliant on meeting people in person. With events only taking place in the US, this made building relationships much harder for people living in other countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the WordPress project started out in the US, the WordPress community quickly globalized. Dozens of WordCamps and hundreds of Meetup events take place around the globe every year.\u00a0 All of these events bring a wide variety of people sharing their enthusiasm for WordPress together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Mario, the birth of WordCamp Europe was something magical. The fact that hundreds, and later on thousands, of people from all over the world gathered around the topic of WordPress speaks for itself. Mario has been involved with organizing WordCamp Europe twice (in 2014 and 2015).\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like meeting WordPress enthusiasts and professionals from more than 50 countries brainstorming and working together at a WordCamp.

That also makes it easier to build businesses and teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cBeing able to use a tool that is user-friendly, not overly complicated and easily extensible makes introducing it to team members faster and easier.

This boosts the entire ecosystem.\u201d</em></p><cite>Mario Peshev</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Helping Others</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario also introduced WordPress to children and young people. He taught them how to use WordPress as a tool for homework and class assignments. By using WordPress, they were able to learn the basics of designing themes, developing plugins, marketing statistics, social media, copywriting, and so much more. This approachable introduction to the software meant technical skills were not needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was also part of a team of volunteers who helped a group of young people living at a foster home struggling to provide for themselves. The team taught the basic digital literacy skills necessary in the modern workplace and potentially pay for their rent and basic needs. This included working with Microsoft Word, Excel and WordPress, as well as some basic design and marketing skills.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>\u201cWhen you look at that from another perspective, a platform that could save lives \u2013 literally \u2013 and change the world for better is worth contributing to, in any possible manner.\u201d</em></p><cite>Mario Peshev</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contributing to the WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From the core team to supporting and organizing WordCamps, Mario has long been an active contributor to the global WordPress project.

In High School, she pursued a career in Computer Science. She said: \u201cI did not know what I would be doing or how I would get there but I just knew that I was going to pursue a career in information technology.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She wrote her first line of code at the age of 16 living in Zimbabwe, Africa. This was to mark the beginning of her enthusiasm for computer programming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she joined the school\u2019s computer class, Thelma thought she would learn Excel and Word. Instead, the assignment was to write her first program in C. She said: \u201cIt was not easy, but it was very exciting. l remember writing up simple code for a Video Club \u2013 a check-in/out for VHS tapes and CDs. Thus began my fascination with computers.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seven years later, she went on to university to study for a Bachelors in Business Management and Information Technology. Her third year internship was at a local web design and hosting company. Though she had hoped her placement would be at a local bank or telecommunications company, the chance to discover website design turned out to be the best thing that could have happened.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, Thelma went on to work for a company designing websites using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and Joomla. She had heard about WordPress but had not used it. She recalls: \u201cPeople have this misconception that WordPress is not for real developers and it is not secure and at that time I was one of those people.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding a local community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From a discussion with a member of the local WordPress community, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/wordpress-opened-whole-new-world/\">Thabo Tswana</a>, about a striking swag gift from a WordCamp, Thelma\u2019s interest was sparked.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She started to find out more about WordPress and WooCommerce, and visited her local WordCamp Harare website. She was delighted to find that she could learn more about WordPress without needing any pre-existing knowledge, and wanted to be involved. So instead of just attending the camp, she volunteered too!\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her response to her first WordPress event mirrors the experience of many others in the community. She said: \u201cI only started using WordPress because of the awesome people that l had met at that WordCamp. Everyone was so welcoming.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A week later, with help from Thabo, she designed her first website using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She soon became more involved with the community and Meetups. Thelma participated in the first-ever \u2018Women Who WordPress\u2019 Meetup in 2018, with lots of women getting involved from bloggers to developers.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: \u201cWe were free to talk and discuss a lot of things. We had more time to discuss the difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org, we shared views on how to handle discrimination at work, how to promote your website and a whole lot of other things.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Establishing roots in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, WordCamp Harare had its first-ever female Lead Organizer <a href=\"https://tapiwanashe.com/\">Tapiwanashe Manhobo</a>. Thelma was part of the organising team that year and was assigned to handle Harare\u2019s first Kids Camp to take place eight months later. You can read more about her experiences of organizing a <a href=\"https://thelmachido.wordpress.com/2019/11/21/wordpress-juniours-first-edition/\"><strong>Kids Camp</strong></a> on her blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: \u201cAfter the first Kids Camp, we had several people in the local Zimbabwean WordPress community who were enthusiastic about encouraging young people to embrace ICT. In 2019, we had not planned to have a Kids Camp because of financial constraints but to our surprise, we had some anonymous donations and we managed to have a WordPress Community outreach to a youth centre, <a href=\"https://cttzim.org/\"><strong>Centre for Total Transformation</strong></a>, a week after our WordCamp. It is a non-formal school that caters for underprivileged and vulnerable children. The group were able to share practical skills about using WordPress, computer hardware and software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thelma shares that she became hooked on WordPress because of its community. \u201cI enjoy attending WordCamps, meeting new people and just learning new stuff. I have a huge list of WordCamps I would like to attend. Last year I managed to cross WordCamp Johannesburg off my list. When everything is back to normal my plan to travel to WordCamps will proceed (fingers crossed).\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reaping the fruits of ongoing learning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thelma is committed to ongoing development training. She said: \u201cEven though I can still cook up code in C and Java, for now, I have also included WordPress PHP functions to the mix. It was not easy to get to this point, daring myself got me to this slightly better stage. I try to do my best where I can and I am happy to say it has paid off so far.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thelma has continued her journey working in design and digital marketing last year with Trust Nhokovenzo who works in digital marketing and is active in\u00a0 the WordPress Community. He came across her name as a developer from talking with others involved in WordPress. She went to work with his team at a marketing agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her interest in the development of WordPress continued and she joined the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">5.6 Release Squad</a> in the mid 2020.\u00a0At the end of 2020, she moved to become a Happiness Engineer working with WordPress.com.

For the first time in 2019, this survey was translated into 5 different languages: French, German, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first WordPress Contributor Survey was conducted in 2015, but unfortunately the results were never published. This report includes Contributor Survey results from both 2015 and 2019.\u00a0 </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Survey Segments</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Major groups in the survey included: WordPress Professionals, WordPress Users, and Others.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>WordPress Professionals</strong> group consists of those who: work for a company that designs/develops websites; use WordPress to build websites and/or blogs for others; design or develop themes, plugins, or other custom tools for WordPress sites; or are a designer, developer, or other web professional working with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This WordPress Professionals group is further divided into <strong>WordPress Company Pros</strong> (those who work for a company that designs/develops websites) and <strong>WordPress Freelancers/Hobbyists</strong> (all other professional types) subgroups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>WordPress User</strong> group consists of those who: own or run a blog that is built with WordPress; own or run a website that is built with WordPress; write for or contribute to a blog/website that is built with WordPress; use WordPress for school as a teacher; use WordPress for school as a student, or are learning to build websites using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Others</strong> group consists of those who did not self-identify with any of the options provided for the question, \u201cWhich of the following best describes how you use WordPress?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2019 Survey Results Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress remains the platform of choice for future projects among those surveyed. Overwhelmingly, the reasons cited for this are that WordPress is the CMS people already know, and that the community supporting it is valuable. Professionals and users report similar levels of frustration with updates and Gutenberg. Both groups also love the ease of use they find in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of professionals who report providing a heavily customized experience to clients has increased substantially, while at the same time the amount of time reported on creating those sites has decreased. Regardless of frustrations felt with various features, this seems to indicate that ease of use has been on the rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More details on sentiment, usage, and other interesting topics are available in the report: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FI7eEvSB5SHTSILIBpwOmH9rBffgD6mFnnqSkrEScYo/edit#slide=id.g71a4c4edc6_3_232\">check it out!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Before you go: take the 2020 Survey!</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing why and how people use WordPress helps those who build WordPress to keep your needs and preferences in mind.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey will be open for at least 6 weeks, and results will be published on this blog.

Both Matt and I are long-time supporters of Creative Commons. I hope that this will provide a long-term, sustainable challenger to closed source photo libraries and further enhance the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How Does This Affect Current Users?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Current CC Search users will continue searching and using openly licensed images from around the internet. WordPress plans to continue the great work started by the Creative Commons project and expand search capabilities and features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What\u2019s Next?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We look forward to indexing and searching additional media, such as audio and video. As we expand our capabilities and grow the project, we look forward to integrating directly into WordPress and the media library. We hope to not only allow search and embeds of openly licensed media but pay it forward by additionally licensing and sharing your media back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How Can You Contribute?\u00a0</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stop by the Slack channel, <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02012JB00N\">#openverse</a>, and take a look at the code repositories moved under the WordPress organization <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/?q=openverse\">here on GitHub</a>.

She later joined her first WordCamp in Ahmedabad, India. This three day event in 2017 opened up a new world\u2014the WordPress community\u2014and what would become a life changing moment. \u201cWordCamp Ahmedabad has one of the best WordPress communities in India,\u201d she said, \u201cand everyone, including organizers and attendees were so humble and welcoming.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/pooja600x600.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9654\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/pooja600x600.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/pooja600x600.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/02/pooja600x600.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The thirst for learning</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A fascination with how things worked and a desire never stop learning were traits that shone through in Pooja from a young age. She moved from Banera, a rural village in India, to a nearby city, where she lived with her uncle while completing her higher education. With her enthusiasm for learning, she decided to become an engineer. When thinking back on that time she says, \u201cBeing from a rural background, people in my village tended not to be keen on the idea of sending their girl child to another city for further studies. Fortunately, that was not the case for me because my parents were immensely supportive of me and my interests. They\u2019ve always encouraged me to believe in myself and fulfill my dreams. With their support, I pursued my engineering in electronics and communication.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Discovering the opportunities in web development\u00a0</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On completing her engineering training, Pooja was not sure what to do next. One of her friends suggested that she should explore web development. The idea intrigued her, and she sought out learning resources to study. She also secured an internship as a PHP Developer to give herself the chance to learn alongside professionals in the field.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Getting started with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p><strong>\u201cI found WordPress surpassed other platforms. The vast knowledge base made it easy for me to learn.\u201d \u2013 Pooja</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This internship led Pooja to her first job where she discovered a range of content management systems. Her view of the opportunities offered by these systems changed when the manager assigned her a small project using the WordPress platform.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recalls: \u201cI found WordPress surpassed other platforms I had worked on earlier. The vast knowledge base made it easy for me to learn.\u201d She soon became comfortable managing WordPress, working with plugins and themes, and wanted to learn it more in-depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pooja soon joined WPVibes as its first team member. Being part of a new startup gave her a lot of experience and a chance to be involved in new processes. As the company expanded they started providing custom plugin development services per the client\u2019s requirement and created some free and paid plugins. Pooja said, \u201cWe found it very exciting and productive. Today, we are a team of 10.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Encouragement from the WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p><strong>Contributing to WordPress increases your knowledge</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>At the event, she was able to listen to speakers from India and abroad, many of whom shared their journey with WordPress and how it had changed their lives. \u201cOne of the most inspiring sessions was by Rahul Bansal,\u201d she said. \u201cHe talked about contributing to WordPress and giving back to the community. He also explained how contributing to WordPress can help you to enhance your knowledge. It inspired me to contribute to WordPress.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community of Ahmedabad continued to inspire Pooja and her husband Anand Upadhyay, and they later started a Meetup group in their home city of Ajmer as part of their contribution to the community. They continue to be involved in supporting local users through the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/ajmer-wordpress-meetup/\">Ajmer Meetup</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KmA8iDgGrRar_cgD2jp2ThrzPxuzGTSI7SWkxDdHKyN4p2iNoj0e-VdOxO0xa1TtH56Uci9wEfYYfnW8DYji8c1HuaI7L-xhNqXyXt_kdchWtVxe_PnSea2knlWhP_O7qqG0Quju\" alt=\"Pooja with a WordCamp Ahmedabad badge\" width=\"500\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the next WordCamp Pooja attended, she joined its contributor day, which brings users together to give back to the open source platform and global community. Most of the contributors she met were interested in giving time to the WordPress CMS. She decided to venture into a different path and took her first steps by joining the WordPress TV group, where you can explore videos from WordPress events across the world. She also discovered the joy of translating into her local language, and is a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglot</a> contributor for the Hindi language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, she was selected as a volunteer for WordCamp Asia in Bangkok, Thailand, and it became an impetus to become even more involved with the community. She was very excited about this role, and to be part of her first WordCamp outside India. Sadly, due to the global COVID pandemic, the event had to be cancelled. Her enthusiasm has not diminished and she is eagerly waiting to support in-person WordCamps in the future and meet even more members of the global community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her determination to be part of making WordPress and sharing skills has only increased, which has led to contribute to the WordPress Training team. This team manages lesson plans and prepares content to support people who are training others to use WordPress. The team recently joined a few other teams to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/introducing-learn-wordpress/\">launch Learn WordPress</a>, which brings learning materials together for users of all levels, and Pooja contributed to two different teams during the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Message to the WordPress Community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pooja is eager to share her belief in the power for good in the WordPress community. \u201cThere is a huge community to help you with your learning, so start learning and try to give back to the community. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are not comfortable with programming, there are many different ways in which you can contribute.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat I have learned in my life is that it doesn\u2019t matter from where you came and what background you have. All that matters is your hard work and positive attitude towards life.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more stories in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/heropress/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>) and Nalini Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>) for writing this story, and to Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\">@sthakor</a>), Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">@chanthaboune</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\">@meher</a>), Chlo\u00e9 Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\">@cbringmann</a>), Olga Glekler (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/oglekler/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>oglekler</a>), Christopher Churchill (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/vimes1984/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>vimes1984</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>lmurillom</a>), and Yvette Sonneveld (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/yvettesonneveld/\">@yvettesonneveld</a>) for work on the series this month.

She is so impressed by remote working benefits, that she is now considering writing about it for a thesis for her Master\u2019s Degree, which she started this year in Europe.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"387\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/05/B5939AF2-DFFD-4471-B3F1-7738F82CEF8A.png?resize=632%2C387&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Fike pictured with a snow background\" class=\"wp-image-10291\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/05/B5939AF2-DFFD-4471-B3F1-7738F82CEF8A.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/05/B5939AF2-DFFD-4471-B3F1-7738F82CEF8A.png?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/05/B5939AF2-DFFD-4471-B3F1-7738F82CEF8A.png?resize=768%2C470&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As a keen blogger, WordPress immediately impressed Fike. Her dad is a programmer, and he helped her create the first of many blogs starting when she was 10 years old. She had private and public blogs, and even an English language one to help her practice and improve her skills. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><strong>\u201cI got satisfaction and happiness from pouring my thoughts in writing and publishing them in my blog. Writing my thoughts and feelings often helped me process them, and does even now.\u201d</strong></p><cite>Fike Komala</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With a natural talent and love for languages, Fike pursued an Information Systems degree after graduating from high school. Her course covered business learning Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Android programming. She also took courses to learn Bootstrap and Ruby on Rails.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Earning Through Building With WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fike\u2019s parents had a business building websites. She was drawn to this work and would help proofread and format the articles. This is how she first encountered WordPress, which was to play a pivotal role in her future career. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cI saw WordPress as something more advanced than other platforms, with more themes and plugins to choose from. The default WordPress websites already looked more professional than others.\u201d</p><cite>Fike Komala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout school, Fike\u2019s experience with WordPress and blogging helped her earn extra money safely online, including translating texts from English to Indonesia, online surveys, and writing articles in English.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Discovering Work You Enjoy\u00a0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The last year at University required a year-long full-time internship. Fike worked as an intern at a big general insurance company within the IT quality control staff. She enjoyed working with the people she met and learned a lot through this opportunity, but she declined the offer of a full-time position.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fike is a good student who loves learning and did well in her education. Through her traditional internship experience,  she found that programming in an office job did not fulfill her. It strengthened her belief in a finding a career where she could have the freedom and creativity of working remotely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI was a good student, I love learning algorithms, but I didn\u2019t love programming. I\u2019m not that person who can stay calm finding errors in their codes, and then finding out that it\u2019s only missing a character,\u201d said Fike. She added: \u201cI don\u2019t really like the fact that I have to wake up at 6 AM and be back home at 7 PM, and do it all over again the next day.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adventure Into Remote Work\u00a0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fike spent time improving her freelance profile, revising it, and applying to jobs as a virtual assistant. She was willing to do any small website jobs such as formatting WordPress posts, designing social media posts, and processing orders for online shops. Through a freelance job submission site, she was able to work with people from across the globe, including Singapore, Australia, Europe, and America. Through the site, Fike was able to gain experience with remote working tools like Slack, Asana, Trello, and Google Suites, and the work gave her practice writing in English.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was through this site that Fike saw a job opportunity with a WordPress plugin company. She sent in her profile and blog.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis was my first time being interviewed via a video call. I was ecstatic but panicked. On the day, I woke up at 4 AM, got dressed, and opened my laptop. Weirdly, my wi-fi died that morning. So I went to the nearest cafe to get the interview done, and it went great!\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was hired to deliver consistency on the company\u2019s blog.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through her job, Fike first began to contribute within the WordPress community and was able to attend her first WordCamp, WordCamp Jakarta 2018, sponsored by her firm. Through WordPress, Fike has met many generous, trusting, and helpful people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: \u201cBecause I\u2019ve experienced the generosity of the WordPress people, I wanted to give back to the community.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZDAmqCcebOQII99V2RMYmJikoQ3u-tjy6BcCT39QWsOUrAqq2_HeqJ1735UoxVyQHTO_S_V9lzZEJ7WayLb8kY3or78oqG4Xt5ujbNUpt7Vcz7r20lp9XopkPwh85imnvRxjpWTx\" alt=\"WordCamp swag\"><figcaption>Swag from WordCamp Jakarta 2018, that\u2019s Wapuu ondel-ondel!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><strong>\u201cI got to know the amazing community behind WordPress. How people voluntarily contribute their time, energy, and skills to the community, from development, marketing to translating.</strong> <strong>It was really inspiring.\u201d</strong></p><cite>Fike Komala</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>You Can Inspire Others Through Contributing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fike has been an inspiration to people in her local community and globally within the WordPress community through her enthusiasm and energy.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHSAV_NJtTA\">talks about her joy in contributing</a> during a live interview as part of WordPress Translation Day in 2020.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So determined to encourage others to become translators of WordPress, she joined the Global Translation Day event with the Indonesian Community last year and took part in wider marketing of the event. She is pictured below with some of the Indonesian polyglots team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She continues to support the polyglots and is a General Translation Editor for the Indonesian language. Last year, she also voiced an <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ifqabp-36_c\">Indonesian translation of the onboarding video</a> for new contributors joining WordPress.org. She has been a regular contributor to the PerempuanWP, an initiative for Indonesian women working in the WordPress world. Working with a firm which uses the WordPress platform has strengthened her familiarity with projects in the community and encourages her interest in contributing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/H-8VelQbbEb9f5MM-SUXNudVD9U1DNs546yt_cWGRU--GSLm-PCUunnHDNFmquv9w3rWOUadxkbYr9bYsRU1Ecmhb6Ee_Deg_paNEIyyqs91_3DjgtlmfgCA_P45GNA5nf5rmpCe\" alt=\"Indonesian translation team \"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about contributing to WordPress, visit <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">make.wordpress.org/</a> and follow the \u201cget involved\u201d link. You can join any of the weekly team meetings to get started, and there is a lot of help available.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fike says, \u201cI want to represent Asian women. In the future, I hope I can inspire more women, especially Asians, to work remotely.\u201d She is now studying in Europe for a Master\u2019s in Digital Communication Leadership. She hopes to use her learning to help other women, particularly back in her home country of Indonesia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She continues to share her energy for learning and remote working. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>Just learn things. As much as you can. From anywhere, about anything. Keep an open mind. Read books, listen to podcasts, and learn new skills.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>She added: \u201cIf you\u2019re working in the WordPress world, join the WordPress community. It\u2019s a great place to learn from and connect with great people.\u201d</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>) and Meg Phillips (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/megphillips91/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>megphillips91</a>) for writing this feature, to Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>sthakor</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>meher</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>lmurillom</a>), Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">@chanthaboune</a>), Chlo\u00e9 Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>cbringmann</a>) for additional support and graphics, and to Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">@topher1kenobe</a>) who created HeroPress.

{"title": "People of WordPress: Olga Gleckler", "content": "<p><em>WordPress is open source software, maintained by a global network of contributors. There are many examples of how WordPress has changed people\u2019s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of the amazing stories that are lesser-known.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From a natural interest in computers and fixing things as a young woman, Olga Gleckler from St Petersburg, Russia, found WordPress took her on a journey to becoming a successful female tech entrepreneur. On International Women\u2019s Day, we share her story.\u00a0\u00a0</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=580%2C768&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Olga with a WordCamp Vienna t-shirt\" class=\"wp-image-9878\" width=\"580\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=773%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 773w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=226%2C300&amp;ssl=1 226w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=768%2C1018&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=1159%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1159w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?resize=1546%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1546w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?w=1932&amp;ssl=1 1932w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/WCEU-2020-online.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Finding your path can take longer than you expect</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From the age of 15, Olga found herself under pressure to find a free place for her professional studies. She said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know how high or low my chances were even if I had very good marks. I could have been just the biggest fish in a small pond. But anyway, I made up my mind to go to technical school.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On leaving school in St Petersburg with her certificate, Olga felt her knowledge of opportunities was very narrow. She had pictured being an ecologist or guide translator based on the subjects she had been taught at school. There was also an advertising boom in Russia and she began to explore this as a career avenue. She had developed her computer skills and found opportunities to practise by helping her teachers with administrative work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though she did not have access to any formal career advice, her journey led her into programming. She said: \u201cThe range of technical schools was not wide. I spent four years studying transistor markings, soldering and drawing PCB layouts. Programming courses using Pascal didn\u2019t do anything useful with it.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lack of suitable access to English-language courses made things harder for Olga. She was determined that she would master the language later in her life. In the meantime, she left technical school with an honors degree and improved typing skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI faced it was a wild, unfriendly market. I didn\u2019t know how to recognize a genuine job offer or how to avoid the bad ones. It was difficult and I don\u2019t know how long I would\u2019ve looked for work without help.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Think differently to find where you belong</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga\u2019s father worked in an IT company and was able to give her some advice and help with potential introductions. When she was still studying, he suggested her strong technical skills might be useful as a substitute typist. When she finished her studies, he helped her apply for a job updating a legal system on clients\u2019 computers.<br><br>Six months later, she got a full-time job in the same service department. She liked her position and her clients. However, she was given friendly advice that without a university degree she would not be able to have any further promotions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this time, Olga was trying to study PHP from a book. She found it very exciting at first, but a lot of their functions did not give her explanations on how to build something useful. She found when she tried to build practical items from book reading, it did not always make sense and the solutions would often fail.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: \u201cIt was hard to admit a failure even to myself and it was nagging me for a long time. I had to choose something I could handle, that I was interested in and could afford. It turned out to be advertising.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She spent most of the family\u2019s holidays on learning sessions during the next six years. Olga recalled: \u201cIt was tricky for my husband to make me leave a computer, once I was glued to it, so he bought me my first laptop. English was still hard for me, I got high marks through just memorizing all the words in a textbook and how they should sound.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Doubting your professional skills can happen when you are at home isolated looking after children. Keeping up your interests is important.</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga\u2019s life took a change after having a new baby and she spent three years doubting her professional skills and her chances of getting a good job. She tried to get back into other interests through studying, baking and drawing, but found \u2018the pram was pulling me back\u2019. She found she became very isolated and felt less able to contribute as the family was relying on her husband\u2019s income as she tried to focus on looking forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: \u201cI was convinced (and saw) that not too many companies wanted a woman in the office, who with a small baby might need lots of leave.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She finished her education when she returned to work after three years caring for her son. She secured a promotion but with changes in the company\u2019s staffing, things were tense. She found the difficulties there had become more heightened and felt that young female colleagues were treated as \u2018pieces of furniture\u2019 by one manager. She did not want to stay in this environment and in a few months time decided to leave.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Your next chapter may be nearby</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Determined to not repeat this type of experience, Olga looked at the brighter side. She said: \u201cI wanted to be a marketer. Knowing how tricky it is to sell intangibles, I wanted a solid product to work with.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turned out to be more difficult to find a job outside traditional IT as a young mother. Some human resource officers advised her to remain within the technology arena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga remained hopeful and continued to study hard. She had many learning experiences along the way, which she hopes others can learn from too. One was setting a low bar to employers. She said: \u201cCompanies I worked in wanted to get all publicity and sales increases achieved through deductions from my salary.\u201d This happened once and the next time she was in this situation she asked specifically about the budget before signing up. \u201cI was assured this would not be the case, but again I found the budget for publicity came out of my wages. It was a tough period of disappointments. So when I was offered a part-time administrative job with basic sick leave, I took it gladly as a reprieve.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The job was far from home and involved a lot of travelling. Olga spent two to three hours a day on buses with Harry Potter audio books for company. \u201cIn these traffic jams, I started to feel English at last and loved it. It gave me a freedom no money can buy. Life was getting better.\u201d </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the job did not pay highly, it gave her something valuable \u2013 a working website. After her boss and the developer parted company, she was asked to maintain the site. Through some studying and reverse engineering, she discovered how it worked and it gave her an insight into how to write simple websites from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga\u2019s first encounter with JavaScript wasn\u2019t easy: \u201cMy first JavaScript calculator almost made me crazy, but I pursued it.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quickly she started to get small tasks from friends and relatives, usually to solve some urgent problems and started to meet popular content management systems. One of the first she met with was WordPress. There was an issue in a website theme used by a website which had been changed and not maintained. It took a whole weekend to solve, but she was determined to work it out. Back then, WordPress was \u2018just a system\u2019. She didn\u2019t know then how much it was to become part of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga spent the next two years in this role. As time went on, she started to feel worried and less satisfied with the work. The last straw for her was a negative statement from her boss, who was not a programmer and who hadn\u2019t seen any of the work done on the website. She felt the approach was unfair as she had done extensive work on the site. She recalls: \u201cI became angry, but it was exactly what I needed to move jobs.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Olga was job hunting, she didn\u2019t feel she had the courage to apply for a developer\u2019s role, despite the learning and work she had already done. So instead she started working on projects where she felt she was more like a \u2018seller of box-ready websites\u2019. It was another tough half a year for her with a lot of work, low payment and plans not turning out as she had hoped. On top of long hours, she ended up with pneumonia. She said: \u201cI see now that I was doing a disservice to customers, websites are not a microwave meal \u2013 quick, cheap and dummy. There was no life in the sites without a lot of work which no one was willing to buy. Most of the sites I sold back then died after the first year and they never were truly alive and useful.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>You need to be brave and have courage</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=632%2C422&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Olga in Berlin wearing the WordPress Code is Poetry lanyard and a WordCamp t-shirt\" class=\"wp-image-9879\" width=\"632\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019.jpg?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga really wanted a developer job but seeking jobs of this type was very frustrating. From the job adverts she found, it felt like most IT companies were asking for geniuses who already knew a lot of technologies and frameworks. She found this very demotivating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She then found a job offer on a website outside the most popular job portals  and it seemed like a perfect fit. They wanted someone with experience to write from scratch, understand someone else\u2019s code and maintain it, with an ability to translate technical documentation and articles, and make simple designs for printing products. After completing a trial task, she was taken on, and enjoyed a better salary, in a calm environment with good colleagues and without the requirement for a lot of extra hours.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advert turned out to be a direct ad from one of the sales departments in a technology company. By succeeding in the  task set, Olga had bypassed the Human Resources team which she felt\u00a0would not normally have considered her.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her boss agreed to her working remotely most of the time. It solved any potential leave problems which Olga had thought may be an obstacle.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Olga it had been 14 years since the original decision to become a programmer and it was only the beginning.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few years at what she describes as an \u2018amazing experience\u2019 in this workplace, Olga felt able to move on to her next challenge as a developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Decision-making can benefit from wider knowledge</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After working with different systems Olga became sure that WordPress is the best CMS for developers and clients. But she was disappointed to find that the ease of use meant that good code was not always a priority for some of the sites she looked at.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe biggest flaw of WordPress \u2013 it\u2019s so easy to make things work that some may feel they don\u2019t need to bother to do things right, but this becomes a problem later.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In custom themes for a site, she also saw sites being made and clients left without any further support, or items hard coded when clients actually needed more control to change regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga used to rely on examples she could easily find, documentation and search engines to improve her understanding in using WordPress. She discovered that just by searching for a specific feature or a solution, you can miss the whole picture.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She turned to online courses to get more comprehensive knowledge and then started to attend WordPress events, firstly online and then by foot, trains and planes! She discovered a worldwide community that was very much alive. She didn\u2019t know when she started studying online materials and attending discussions that she would end up contributing herself to the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> platform a few years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamps and contributor days became a big part of her life. From her early days attending events and starting out contributing to WordPress, she is an active member of the WordPress.org Global Marketing and Polyglots Teams, and supported the recent WordPress release. She is just beginning her first WordCamp organiser experience, joining WordCamp Europe 2021 on the Contribute Team. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=632%2C602&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Olga next to a banner of WordCamp St Petersburg 2018\" class=\"wp-image-9883\" width=\"632\" height=\"602\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=1024%2C976&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=300%2C286&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=768%2C732&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=1536%2C1464&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?resize=2048%2C1951&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/St-Petersburg-2018.jpg?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Olga said: \u201cThrough the wider WordPress community, I knew not only where to look but also whom to ask. Most importantly, I found allies who don\u2019t think I\u2019m going crazy by speaking with delight about work, and with whom I share a passion and fondness for WordPress. This is what matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNow, after more than seven years of full time development, I am still enjoying endless learning, frequent discoveries, mistakes and an impassioned wish to do better.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This and a desire to help others use WordPress.org is part of Olga\u2019s continued contribution to its Support and Marketing Teams, and led her to be involved in the Release Marketing questions and answers in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>There is no chequered flag on the way</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"946\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?resize=632%2C946&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Olga at WordCamp Europe in Berlin in 2019\" class=\"wp-image-9881\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?resize=684%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?resize=1025%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1025w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?w=1367&amp;ssl=1 1367w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/03/Berlin-2019-1.jpg?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The road to freedom and becoming her own boss has not been easy for Olga. It is the path that got her where she is today, and she continues to find joy in it. She retains the lessons she\u2019s learned and is always hungry to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0\u201cI travelled through a very uneven path, with a lot of obstacles and noise, but for me it\u2019s like a kaleidoscope where a little turn presents a new picture, a new \u201cah-ha\u201d moment, new excitement after seemingly pointless efforts.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: \u201cWhen in doubt I remind myself about David Ogilvy (generally considered the Founding Father of the modern advertising industry) who tried a lot of things before he struck gold with advertising, and maybe that\u2019s why he did.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, she learned not only to keep a good spirit and try different things, but also to dare as you move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contributors</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">@webcommsat</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>lmurillom</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>meher</a>), Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">@chanthaboune</a>), Chlo\u00e9 Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>cbringmann</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\">@topher1kenobe</a>).
