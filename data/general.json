{"title": "MU 1.0 and bbPress", "content": "<p>The WordPress family has been really starting to grow lately. I wanted to let you guys know about two big releases: WordPress Multi-user 1.0 and bbPress 0.72.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mu.wordpress.org/\">WordPress MU</a> is an official branch of WordPress that is designed for managing and hosting thousands of blogs instead of just one. It\u2019s the software that powers <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a>, for example. MU has been in heavy development for about a year now, and we\u2019ve finally polished it up to a place where we feel like it\u2019s ready for public consumption. Since setup is a bit more complex than the 5-minute install of regular WordPress, MU is best suited for a more server-savvy audience. You can <a href=\"https://mu.wordpress.org/download/\">download it on the WordPress MU site</a>.</p>\n<p>Second I wanted to introduce an old friend you are all probably familiar with from our support forums, <a href=\"https://bbpress.org/\">bbPress</a>. bbPress is forum software with the WordPress touch, and developed by the same folks. It has some pretty cool features, such as tagging, RSS feeds, Akismet spam protection, AJAX interaction, but the team focused the most on creating something fast and light. bbPress can power a forum with hundreds of thousands of posts with just a fraction of the load as WordPress. (If we could re-write WP from scratch, it would be a lot like bbPress.) What is probably most compelling for WordPress users, though, is that bbPress supports complete user and login integration with WP.</p>\n<p>bbPress is not quite 1.0 yet, some of you may recognize the 0.72 version number from the early days of WordPress, but if you\u2019re searching for a little something fresh in forum software, try <a href=\"https://bbpress.org/download/\">downloading bbPress</a> and giving it a go.</p>"},

We all came for WordCamp Orlando (fun!) and are staying a couple of extra days to discuss the vision for WordPress in the coming year, the merge, canonical plugins, the WordPress.org site, community stuff, and all the other things that are important but that we never seem to have time to address. Since when things like this come up in the IRC dev chat or in various forums there\u2019s inevitably a point at which someone says, \u201cWe really need to have [insert a core committer name here] here to make a decision,\u201d we thought it would make sense to get together and figure out where everyone stands on all these ideas so that we can move forward a little more efficiently. Also, not all the committers had met in person before (and I\u2019d never met Andrew or Peter), so it\u2019s also a chance for us to just get to know each other a little. Watch this space around Tuesday or Wednesday for a post summarizing the things we\u2019ve discussed, and the beginning of planning for how members of community can get involved in (or spearhead) the things that interest them.</p>"},
{"title": "So, what\u2019s with the WPMU blog?", "content": "<p>Welcome to the first post of the first blog on the wordpress.org domain dedicated solely to WordPress MU (WPMU).</p>\n<p>Sure, this isn\u2019t most likely going to see the light of day for some time, but it\u2019s important to have it here, don\u2019t you think?</p>\n<p>Anyway, down to business\u2026</p>\n<p>The problem, as it stands is that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There isn\u2019t enough centralized support material and communication for WPMU</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is pretty much down to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There\u2019s a lot of duplication between WP and WPMU resources, with 98% of regular WP codex stuff applying to WPMU</li>\n<li>There aren\u2019t as many WPMU users / devs\u2026 it\u2019s just not as popular because fewer people need it</li>\n<li>And when they do need it, it\u2019s usually for other people rather than themselves \u2013 to paraphrase Douglas Adams, I\u2019ll spend days working out how to save myself a minute once a fortnight, but not much bother with stuff that\u2019ll save other people weeks (OK, the last bit was me <img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif?w=632&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\";)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"> </li>\n<li>Let\u2019s face it, we\u2019re an offshoot, a kinda more complicated sibling</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, we\u2019re not going to manage to get around this by mimicking what\u2019s happened for WP \u2013 we\u2019ve been doing that for a while, without any luck.</p>\n<p>So, what I propose is this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> WPMU (via this site) exchanges linkworthy respect and credit for knowledgeable people penning articles about aspects of WPMU here, as Contributors and Authors</li>\n<li>Those articles are, as they come in, organized a la faq.wordpress.com an dmaintained by their respective authors (with assistance from a set of editors \u2013 hopefully promoted contributors / authors)</li>\n<li>That is then integrated into the forums and the forums are integrated into this, creating two places where there\u2019s a great deal of good WPMU knowledge</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And that we ditch:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The WPMU codex \u2013 it\u2019s not used, no-one cares, it just give off a bad smell about WPMU an dcan be replaced by a good idex of materials here</li>\n<li>Trying to support WPMU outside of the forums and posts here \u2013 this gives us some good focus</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How does that sound?</p>"},
{"title": "WordPress Wins CMS Award", "content": "<p>I was very excited last week to learn that WordPress has been awarded the Overall Best Open Source CMS Award in the <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/award\">2009 Open Source CMS Awards</a>. This is a landmark for us, as it is the first time we\u2019ve won this award, and it marks a shift in the public perception of WordPress, from blog software to full-featured CMS. No small contest, the Open Source CMS Awards received over 12,000 nominations and more than 23,000 votes across five categories.</p>\n<p>As Hiro Nakamura said when he first bent time and space to land in Times Square: \u201cYatta!\u201d</p>\n<p>In addition to winning in the Overall Best Open Source CMS category, WordPress was named first runner-up in the Best Open Source PHP CMS category. This is significant because we weren\u2019t even in the top 5 last year, and now we\u2019re #2, ahead of Joomla! As is stated on the Award site, \u201cWordPress made its way into the top five for the first time. The fact that it was outranked by Drupal by a very slight margin indicates how popular it has become with users as well as developers over the past year.\u201d</p>\n<p>Every day thousands of new people are embracing WordPress to power not just their blogs but entire sites and communities without compromising on usability or scalability (as would be the case with a legacy CMS). Every member of the WordPress community, from core developer to beginning user, should be proud to be part of this momentum: congratulations to us all!</p>"},
{"title": "New and Improved Plugins Directory Search", "content": "<p>One of the biggest problems and most frequent complaints we\u2019ve had with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/\">WordPress.org Plugins Directory</a> is the horrible, horrible search results.</p>\n<p>No longer.\u00a0 We\u2019re now using <a href=\"http://www.sphinxsearch.com/\">Sphinx</a> (a \u201cfree open-source SQL full-text search engine\u201d) to power search on the Plugins Directory both from the website and from within your blog\u2019s admin (Plugins \u2192 Add New).</p>\n<p>It works much better.  There are a few oddities floating around (our fault not sphinx\u2019s) that we\u2019ll be cleaning up shortly, but we\u2019re happy enough with it on the whole to start letting everyone else use it \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>Currently, the search only indexes the plugin\u2019s title and description/installation/FAQ/etc. (from the plugin\u2019s readme.txt file), but we\u2019ll be adding things like authors and tags soon.</p>"},
{"title": "A Little Support?", "content": "<p>Thanksgiving was last week, and I thought about doing a post to thank the people who contribute to WordPress core, since this is a group of people I\u2019m thankful for on a daily basis. I started a draft, and then realized that with 2.9 in beta, we\u2019ll have a release announcement sometime in the next few weeks (barring unforeseen complications, etc), and all the core contributors will be thanked then. Though I think it\u2019s worth giving thanks every day for the people who make WordPress possible, I don\u2019t like to clutter up anyone\u2019s feed readers with repetitive posts, so I decided to wait until today for my post, and to focus solely on the other group I\u2019d planned to include: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">support forum</a> volunteers.</p>\n<p>Forum volunteers don\u2019t get a lot of flashy attention. There aren\u2019t flame wars about whether or not the support forums should be commercial instead of free and community-run. There generally aren\u2019t big arguments and debates over whose point of view is the right one. What the forums do have is amazing volunteers who give their time to help other WordPress users and developers learn. People who only know a little answer easy questions that maybe they\u2019ve only recently learned the answers to themselves. People with more expert skills help troubleshoot larger issues. If someone offers advice that could be better, others will add their solutions to the mix. Of all the WordPress users I\u2019ve met in person, not one person got started without visiting the forums. In many cases, people turn to the forums even before the Codex. In the support forums, I see a lot of what is best about our community, and almost none of that which is not.*</p>\n<p>Without further ado, here\u2019s my thank you to the volunteers who make the support forums work. Without them, we would be less than what we are today. I\u2019m listing people by their WordPress.org usernames, since that\u2019s how you see them in the forums.</p>\n<p><strong>Official WordPress.org Support Forum Moderators </strong></p>\n<p id=\"userlogin\">These are the people who\u2019ve officially got your back and have been active in the past few months.

I\u2019ve started a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/336953?replies=1\">forum thread</a> to discuss some ideas with the thought that we can try a couple after the holidays and see what takes.</p>\n<p>* <em>I say almost because let\u2019s face it, we all get caught in the traps of trolls sometimes, and patience can be hard to keep when someone is a jerk. So a reminder to all who use the forums: be nice to the people who are trying to help you! \ud83d\ude42</em></p>\n<p>P.S. While I\u2019m at it, here\u2019s another tip/request. Search the forums for your problem before posting; if it\u2019s already been answered before (often more than once), you\u2019re kind of wasting people\u2019s time by posting it again without trying the previous solutions first. Please respect the time of the volunteers by searching first (and mention in your post what you\u2019ve already tried).</p>"},

{"title": "Equity and the Power of Community", "content": "<p>Over the past week, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery. I have been thinking about white supremacy, the injustice that Black women and men are standing up against across the world, and all the injustices I can\u2019t know, and don\u2019t see.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress mission is to democratize publishing, and to me, that has always meant more than the freedom to express yourself. Democratizing publishing means giving voices to the voiceless and amplifying those speaking out against injustice. It means learning things that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t. To me, it means that every voice has the ability to be heard, regardless of race, wealth, power, and opportunity. WordPress is a portal to commerce; it is a canvas for identity, and a catalyst for change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While WordPress as an open source project may not be capable of refactoring unjust judicial systems or overwriting structural inequality, this does not mean that we, the WordPress community, are powerless. WordPress can\u2019t dismantle white supremacy, but the WordPress community can invest in underrepresented groups (whose experiences cannot be substituted for) and hire them equitably. WordPress can\u2019t eradicate prejudice, but the WordPress community can hold space for marginalized voices in our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot of racial, societal, and systemic injustice to fight. At times, change may seem impossible, and certainly, it\u2019s been too slow. But I know in my heart that the WordPress community is capable of changing the world.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to learn more about how to make a difference in your own community, here are a few resources I\u2019ve gathered from WordPressers just like you.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://href.li/?http://www.socialjusticetoolbox.com/\">Social Justice Toolbox</a></li><li><a href=\"http://antiracismforbeginners.com/\">Anti-racism resource list</a></li><li>An open source <a href=\"https://guidetoallyship.com/\">Guide to Allyship</a></li><li><a href=\"https://allienimmons.com/how-to-be-a-wordpress-ally/\">How to be a WordPress Ally</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/black-lives-matter-europe/\">Supporting Black Lives Matter in Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"https://feminisminindia.com/2019/06/03/colourism-fairness-india/\">Cost of Colourism in India</a>\u00a0</li><li><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/verna_myers_how_to_overcome_our_biases_walk_boldly_toward_them?language=en\">Overcoming Biases by Walking Toward Them</a>\u00a0</li></ul>"},

{"title": "State of the Word: the story of the slides", "content": "<p>During the State of the Word at WordCamp US 2019, Matt Mullenweg shared that Gutenberg was used to create his slides and the presentation was powered by the Slides plugin. Using WordPress to power a slide deck isn\u2019t an obvious choice, so we wanted to showcase the process and give some tips for making slide layouts using Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This post is co-written by Ella and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/karmatosed/\">Tammie</a>, who (along with <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/melchoyce/\">Mel</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mapk/\">Mark</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nrqsnchz/\">Enrique</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/itsjonq/\">Q</a></em> <em>and a cast of supporters) helped create this year\u2019s State of the Word slide deck.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How it Started</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ellatrix/\">Ella Van Durpe</a> was selected to speak at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNWNhUPrqB4\">JSConf</a> and ReactEurope and wanted slides for her presentation.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, she\u2019d used Reveal.js to create slides and enjoyed the freedom to create anything using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These languages were comfortable, familiar, and also can be published on the web in their native format.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For these new presentations, she wanted to use Reveal.js again but didn\u2019t feel like writing all the HTML by hand. Creating blocks of content visually, without having to actually write any code, which can be published natively to the web, is exactly what Gutenberg was built for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin was prototyped quickly, with hardcoded styles on the slides and zero options. At the end of each presentation, Ella shared a brief demo of the Gutenberg-based slides and the audience was amazed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ellatrx?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ellatrx</a> any chance you might open source this? \ud83d\ude42 <a href=\"https://t.co/6hygMpBqUA\">https://t.co/6hygMpBqUA</a></p>\u2014 Pascal Birchler (@swissspidy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swissspidy/status/1131573525612048385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 23, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordCamp US approached, Ella suggested that her plugin be used for State of the Word. Since it was such a hit with her audience members, it seemed like this would be a great chance to share it with the WordPress community as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-8233\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2>How it Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Technical information</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin registers a custom post type called \u201cpresentation\u201d and a new \u201cslide\u201d block. The slide block is a sort of enhanced \u201cGroup\u201d block, which is restricted to the root of the post, but you can put any other block inside it. As a result, you have a post filled with only slides at the root and slides filled with content. This maps perfectly to the Reveal.js markup, which requires content in HTML section elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since these slides each have their own design, the theme styles are disabled and styling is set from each slide. A custom presentation template is provided by the plugin to render the custom post on the front-end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then Ella added options to style the slides. For example, she added options to control the slide background and font, at both the document level and individual slide level. She also added Reveal.js options, which allow you to change the transition style and speed. Lastly, she added a custom CSS field to allow style overwrites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the State of the Word, she also added speaker notes and a speaker view.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1256\" height=\"721\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image.png?fit=632%2C363&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8271\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image.png?w=1256&amp;ssl=1 1256w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image.png?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image.png?resize=1024%2C588&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image.png?resize=768%2C441&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How it\u2019s Designed</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1114\" height=\"908\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/01.png?fit=632%2C515&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8262\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/01.png?w=1114&amp;ssl=1 1114w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/01.png?resize=300%2C245&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/01.png?resize=1024%2C835&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/01.png?resize=768%2C626&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The inspiration for the slide designs came from Blue Note album covers (which were also the inspiration for the <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/photomatt/state-of-the-word-2011/\">2011 State of the Word slides</a>). These album covers inspired the recent \u201cAbout\u201d page in WordPress core and the starter content for the new Twenty Twenty theme. This style consists of strong, geometric shapes and simple forms with clean lines. Photography and bold typography are at the heart of this look.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3586\" height=\"3072\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-17.png?fit=632%2C541&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8267\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-17.png?w=3586&amp;ssl=1 3586w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-17.png?resize=300%2C257&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-17.png?resize=1024%2C877&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-17.png?resize=768%2C658&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-17.png?resize=1536%2C1316&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-17.png?resize=2048%2C1754&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-17.png?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/image-17.png?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Various color palettes and font pairings were explored before selecting the best combination for the presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1311\" height=\"845\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/03.png?fit=632%2C407&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8259\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/03.png?w=1311&amp;ssl=1 1311w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/03.png?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/03.png?resize=1024%2C660&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/03.png?resize=768%2C495&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong photographic element was needed for the slides. Past WordCamps are a great source of photos, so we dug through years of photo galleries to find just the right shots. With colors, fonts, and photos, we laid the foundation to build the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tips for Making Gutenberg Slides</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tip One: columns are your friends</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want slides with a precise layout, use columns. As you can see here, we used a 3 column layout to center content within a slide:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"354\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/3.png?resize=632%2C354&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8260\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/3.png?w=874&amp;ssl=1 874w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/3.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/3.png?resize=768%2C431&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tip Two: spacer blocks are useful</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to really unlock the power of columns? Combine them with the spacer block! We used spacer blocks to position content over background images, like in this slide:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/6.png?resize=632%2C360&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8264\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/6.png?w=865&amp;ssl=1 865w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/6.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/6.png?resize=768%2C438&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tip Three: test on large screens</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to preview and test your slides as you go. Make sure to design for the size and aspect ratio of the projector you\u2019ll be using and do a visual check in presentation mode from time to time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1096\" height=\"703\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/notes.png?fit=632%2C405&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8269\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/notes.png?w=1096&amp;ssl=1 1096w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/notes.png?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/notes.png?resize=1024%2C657&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/12/notes.png?resize=768%2C493&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tip Four: check your videos</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A good demo video is integral to showcase new features. Joen Asmussen has a great post on <a href=\"https://automattic.design/2019/11/12/good-ui-demo-videos/\">creating effective demo videos</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lessons learned</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>I\u2019d love to make the art directed compositions easier to create. </em></p><cite><em>Mel Choyce-Dwan</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Gutenberg evolves, one big improvement is that art direction will get easier. Even with the improvements this year, creating some layouts in Gutenberg was trickier than expected. For the more complicated compositions, we relied on SVGs. Eventually, the need for hacks will dissolve away, and a new world of exciting possibilities will open for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Browsers offered one of our biggest learnings in this presentation, more than they would if you use Keynote or Powerpoint, for example (tools most of us have used). Often, we found that what we created in the editor varied a when viewed full-screen. We were able to mitigate this by updating the plugin to use a fixed size, instead of using the entire browser window.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wrapping it up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to check out the State of the Word, you can watch the <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2019/11/03/2019-state-of-the-word/\">video</a> and read all about it in a <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2019/11/state-of-the-word-2019/\">post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Slides plugin is not only available on the plugin repo, but you can also get the code from <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/slides\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/slide/\">help translate</a>.</p>"},

This report includes Contributor Survey results from both 2015 and 2019.\u00a0 </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Survey Segments</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Major groups in the survey included: WordPress Professionals, WordPress Users, and Others.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>WordPress Professionals</strong> group consists of those who: work for a company that designs/develops websites; use WordPress to build websites and/or blogs for others; design or develop themes, plugins, or other custom tools for WordPress sites; or are a designer, developer, or other web professional working with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This WordPress Professionals group is further divided into <strong>WordPress Company Pros</strong> (those who work for a company that designs/develops websites) and <strong>WordPress Freelancers/Hobbyists</strong> (all other professional types) subgroups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>WordPress User</strong> group consists of those who: own or run a blog that is built with WordPress; own or run a website that is built with WordPress; write for or contribute to a blog/website that is built with WordPress; use WordPress for school as a teacher; use WordPress for school as a student, or are learning to build websites using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Others</strong> group consists of those who did not self-identify with any of the options provided for the question, \u201cWhich of the following best describes how you use WordPress?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2019 Survey Results Summary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress remains the platform of choice for future projects among those surveyed. Overwhelmingly, the reasons cited for this are that WordPress is the CMS people already know, and that the community supporting it is valuable. Professionals and users report similar levels of frustration with updates and Gutenberg. Both groups also love the ease of use they find in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of professionals who report providing a heavily customized experience to clients has increased substantially, while at the same time the amount of time reported on creating those sites has decreased. Regardless of frustrations felt with various features, this seems to indicate that ease of use has been on the rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More details on sentiment, usage, and other interesting topics are available in the report: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FI7eEvSB5SHTSILIBpwOmH9rBffgD6mFnnqSkrEScYo/edit#slide=id.g71a4c4edc6_3_232\">check it out!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Before you go: take the 2020 Survey!</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing why and how people use WordPress helps those who build WordPress to keep your needs and preferences in mind.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey will be open for at least 6 weeks, and results will be published on this blog. All data will be anonymized: no email addresses or IP addresses will be associated with published results.

Each of the translated surveys will be promoted through banners on their associated localized-language WordPress.org sites. Please encourage your WordPress pals and social media followers to take the survey too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure your WordPress experience is represented in the 2020 survey results\u2026 don\u2019t delay! </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons aligncenter\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background\" href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/wordpress-2020-survey-english\" rel=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/wordpress-2020-survey-english\">Take the 2020 WordPress Annual Survey!</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>(Also available in <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/wordpress-2020-survey-french\">French</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/wordpress-2020-survey-german\">German</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/wordpress-2020-survey-japanese\">Japanese</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/wordpress-2020-survey-russian\">Russian</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/wordpress-2020-survey-spanish\">Spanish</a>!)</p>"},

Shipping something this impactful is not easy, and there was precedent for keeping the editor as it was: WordPress had already tried to replace TinyMCE a couple of times already. What would be different this time around? The worry was \u201cnot much\u201d and initially, very few people actively joined the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six months later came WordCamp Europe 2017 and the first release of the plugin. The editor was nowhere close to being usable, but it \u201cclicked\u201d for some. The reactions to <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/\">the presentation</a> were hopeful, but afterward, there was a lot of pushback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg was (and is) an audacious project. With a project this big it attracted a lot of attention, and it became difficult to discern constructive debate from mere opposition. We each come with our context, and some people had a fixed idea about what they wanted for the project. Some wanted to reuse an existing page builder, others wanted to revive the Fields API project, some wanted it to be front-end-first, others wanted it just to replace the classic editor\u2019s content area, some wanted it to be in Vue.JS, others wanted no change at all. With a product used by 40% of the web, you hope to find consensus, and when compromises have to be made, it can be difficult for those involved to avoid feeling that their voice is being ignored.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have also made quite a few mistakes: stability wasn\u2019t great in some releases, performance suffered in others, and accessibility as well. But we kept pushing forward, using feedback to improve the editor and the project in all aspects until its first inclusion in WordPress 5.0, and we\u2019re still working to improve it today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where We Are</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a delight to see some people who strongly disagreed with the initial vision or approach to Gutenberg gradually come to enjoy using the editor and join the project to carry on its vision. Others might still not like it; some won\u2019t ever use it. One thing is certain; we\u2019ll continue doing our best to push forward, improve what\u2019s already shipped, and ship new exciting features. We\u2019ll continue making mistakes and hopefully continue learning from them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wednesday marked the 100th release of Gutenberg, and while that looks remarkable on the outside, the release itself holds what all the other releases did. It holds improvements to the existing features, it fixes bugs that users reported, adds new features, and it highlights experiments with new ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is remarkable about the release is the people. The ones who were with us from the start, the ones who were with us but left, the ones who joined in our journey, everyone who helped along the way, everyone who provided feedback, everyone who got their hands dirty, and everyone who tried to use this editor, extend it and provide ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you all.</p>"},

Both Matt and I are long-time supporters of Creative Commons. I hope that this will provide a long-term, sustainable challenger to closed source photo libraries and further enhance the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How Does This Affect Current Users?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Current CC Search users will continue searching and using openly licensed images from around the internet. WordPress plans to continue the great work started by the Creative Commons project and expand search capabilities and features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What\u2019s Next?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We look forward to indexing and searching additional media, such as audio and video. As we expand our capabilities and grow the project, we look forward to integrating directly into WordPress and the media library. We hope to not only allow search and embeds of openly licensed media but pay it forward by additionally licensing and sharing your media back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How Can You Contribute?\u00a0</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stop by the Slack channel, <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02012JB00N\">#openverse</a>, and take a look at the code repositories moved under the WordPress organization <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/?q=openverse\">here on GitHub</a>. You can also follow along with the project on its own make page at: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/openverse\">https://make.wordpress.org/openverse</a>. We are working on setting up the new team, process, and procedures.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join us in welcoming the team and community. As a treat, check out the most recent WP Briefing episode, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/the-commons-of-images/\">The Commons of Images</a>, in which Matt and I discuss CC Search and our hopes for it as part of the WordPress community.</p>"},
{"title": "Dropping support for Internet Explorer 11", "content": "<p>Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) was released over 7 years ago and is currently used by less than <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-version-partially-combined-market-share#monthly-202104-202105-bar\" rel=\"nofollow\">1% of all users on the Internet</a> with usage rapidly declining. A large majority of popular websites have already stopped supporting IE11 (including <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/m365-ie11-microsoft-edge-legacy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft Teams in 2020</a>), and even the Microsoft 365 apps and services will be <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/m365-ie11-microsoft-edge-legacy\" rel=\"nofollow\">dropping support later this year</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When WordPress 5.8 is released in July of this year, Internet Explorer 11 will no longer be supported.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are currently using IE11, it is strongly recommended that you switch to a more modern browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge. IE11 users have been shown a warning that IE11 is considered outdated in the WordPress dashboard for the last 17+ months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are already using one of the more modern browsers above, you will only be positively impacted by this change, as there are performance benefits to dropping IE11 support. However, if any other users of your site are still using IE11, it\u2019s possible they will be affected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does \u201cdropping support\u201d mean?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When support for a browser is removed from WordPress, new features are no longer tested on those browsers and are not guaranteed to function optimally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automated tools that generate parts of the WordPress Core source code are also updated to exclude unsupported browsers. This means that any feature relying on these generated files will likely have bugs or stop working for users of those browsers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor will be the area of WordPress most heavily impacted by this change because almost all of the files related to the block editor are compiled using these automated tools. Other areas of the WordPress dashboard also use CSS built with these tools and their appearance will potentially be impacted when using IE11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All other areas of the code base that are IE11 specific will need to be identified, evaluated, and removed on a case-by-case basis as the rest are manually maintained. This process will begin in the WordPress 5.9 release, and will likely happen gradually over several major releases. Additionally, any bugs which are reported for IE11 will not be fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How will this affect themes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No changes will be made to any of the default bundled themes as a result of this plan. No code related to IE11 support (or any other browser that may have been supported when each theme was released) will be removed from default themes. However, any new features added going forward will not be tested in IE11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not using a default theme, it\u2019s still unlikely that your theme will be affected by this change. Themes typically have their own browser support policies, and changes in WordPress Core do not affect those. It\u2019s possible that your theme author may have removed support for IE11 already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If IE11 support is important to you and you are unsure whether your theme supports IE11, it is recommended that you reach out to your theme\u2019s developer to confirm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information on this change can be found on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/04/22/ie-11-support-phase-out-plan/\">Making WordPress Core blog</a>.</p>"},
